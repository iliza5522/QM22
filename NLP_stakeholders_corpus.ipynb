TOBIN \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Good morning, and welcome to the first hearing of the U.S.-\\nChina Economic and Security Review Commission\\'s 2018 Annual Report cycle.  Thank you all \\nfor joining us, and those of you online as well. \\n\\nThe Commission has been following Xi Jinping\\'s Belt and Road Initiative since \\nits inception in 2013.  Since then, we have watched the initiative rise to the top of Beijing\\'s \\nforeign policy agenda, evolving from a vague blueprint for regional connectivity to a well-\\nresourced, whole-of-government strategy. \\n\\nPresident Xi\\'s signature foreign policy initiative is many things: an economic \\nstimulus plan; the global face of the \"China Dream\"; a marketing strategy; an upgrade of \\nBeijing\\'s \"going out\" policy; a blueprint for economic dominance; and much more. \\n\\nIt\\'s difficult to overstate the potential risks and rewards of the Belt and Road \\nInitiative, both for China and for partnering countries. \\n\\nChinese infrastructure projects have the potential to offload some of the excess \\nindustrial capacity currently weighing down China\\'s economy.  If executed well, they could \\nprovide crucial economic opportunities for developing countries around the world.  They could \\nalso help burnish China\\'s image as a responsible stakeholder and divert attention from more \\naggressive aspects of its foreign policy. \\n\\nOn the other hand, poorly-run projects that prioritize Chinese gains at the expense \\nof the host country\\'s economy and citizenry would be no more than empty economic gestures \\nand could bring significant unpleasant reputational costs to Beijing. \\n\\nPerhaps more concerning, Chinese economic engagement could give way to \\ndangerously lopsided bilateral relationships and create opportunities for Beijing to employ \\ngreater economic coercion against smaller partner countries. \\n\\nSecurity risks abound as well.  For example, although the China-Pakistan \\nEconomic Corridor is arguably the most developed and promising component of the Belt and \\nRoad Initiative, Pakistan has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world for \\nChinese workers and citizens. \\n\\nDespite--or perhaps because of--the enormity of the Belt and Road Initiative, \\nsome U.S. policymakers, businesses and citizens have struggled to understand the breadth and \\ndepth of this effort.  So today we hope to shed light on the current status of the PRC\\'s initiative \\n\\n66\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nand to consider whether and how it has the potential to reshape Eurasia and diminish our ability \\nto positively influence events in the Central, Southeast and South Asia area. \\n\\nTo our accomplished witnesses, thank you for being here to help us navigate this \\nvery important topic with us today.  I look forward to hearing from each of you.  \\n\\nI would also like to thank the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff for \\nsecuring this room for our use today, and now I will turn the floor over to my colleague and co-\\nchair, Commissioner Dennis Shea. \\n\\n77\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER KATHERINE C.

SHEA \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Well, thank you, Commissioner Tobin, and good morning \\neveryone.  I want to thank you all for being here today.  I think some of you may have traveled \\nfar and wide to join us.  So thank you.  And appreciate the time and effort you\\'ve put into your \\nexcellent testimonies. \\n\\nChina does not have a monopoly on plans to facilitate connectivity and trade \\nacross Eurasia and the Indian Ocean region.  During our hearing today, we will examine regional \\nreactions to China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative as well as competing visions for regional \\nconnectivity, which have existed long before the Belt and Road Initiative. \\n\\nFor example, the United States launched the New Silk Road Initiative in 2011.  \\nToday, other regional powers, such as India and Japan, are actively promoting their own \\ninitiatives to bolster economic growth and infrastructure development.  These efforts present \\nopportunities for the United States to work with its allies and partners to provide complementary \\nor alternative options to China\\'s Belt and Road. \\n\\nChinese leaders hope the Belt and Road Initiative will advance Beijing\\'s \\ngeopolitical interests by improving ties with neighbors, securing supply routes, and expanding \\nChina\\'s role in regional and global governance.  But deeper involvement abroad also comes with \\nrisks, including terrorism and instability, fractious local politics in partner countries, and great \\npower rivalry. \\n\\nIn response to these risks, the People\\'s Liberation Army has accelerated its \\npreparations to protect growing Chinese interests overseas.  An increased PLA presence outside \\nof East Asia, driven by the Belt and Road Initiative, will create both geopolitical opportunities \\nand challenges for the United States and requires a thoughtful strategic response from \\nWashington. \\n\\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis recently said, and I quote, \"In a globalized \\nworld, there are many belts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of \\ndictating \\'One Belt, One Road\\'\"--unquote. \\n\\nThe United States has a strong interest in maintaining a free and open Indo-\\nPacific region where international norms and standards are upheld and strengthened.  I look \\nforward to hearing our experts this afternoon unpack the strategic implications of the Belt and \\nRoad Initiative for U.S. interests and for their recommendations on an appropriate U.S. response. \\n\\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that the testimonies and transcript \\nfrom today\\'s hearing will be posted on our website.  That\\'s www.uscc.gov, and also please mark \\nyour calendars for the Commission\\'s upcoming hearing on \"China\\'s Military Reforms and \\nModernization: Implications for the United States,\" which will take place on February 15.   \\n\\nAnd now I\\'ll turn it over to my colleague, Dr. Tobin. \\n\\n1010\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER DENNIS C.

TOBIN \\n \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n Our first panel today will explore the economic drivers and implications of the \\nBelt and Road Initiative.  We are joined by a truly outstanding group of experts to discuss this \\nsubject. \\n We\\'ll begin with Nadège Rolland, Senior Fellow for Political and Security Affairs \\nat the National Bureau of Asian Research.   \\n Prior to joining the Bureau, Ms. Rolland spent two decades advising the French \\nMinistry of Defense on Asian and Chinese strategic issues.  She is the author of the 2017 book \\nChina\\'s Eurasian Century: Political and Strategic Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative, \\nwhich I highly recommend for you to read.  It\\'s compelling. \\n Ms. Rolland will provide testimony today on the economic and strategic drivers \\nand goals of the Initiative, and she\\'ll describe how it has extended China\\'s diplomatic reach and \\nits soft power. \\n Next we\\'ll hear from Jonathan Hillman.  Mr. Hillman is a Fellow at the Center for \\nStrategic and International Studies where he holds the Simon Chair in Political Economy and is \\nthe director of the Reconnecting Asia Project.  And I want to give a shoutout to that because for \\nthose of us who like to see data or visuals, this website is a resource for anyone of us to use.  \\nThere\\'s a map showing the probably hundreds, or more, projects that are underway as part of the \\nBelt and Road Initiative and the infrastructure projects.  But it also contains a database that \\nyou\\'re going to be maintaining over time to catalog what\\'s beginning, what\\'s done, what\\'s never \\ngot underway, et cetera. \\n So prior to joining CSIS, Mr. Hillman served as a policy advisor at the Office of \\nthe U.S. Trade Representative.  He will discuss emerging trends and the Belt Road Initiative\\'s \\nimpact on China\\'s trade and investment patterns. \\n We\\'ll then hear from Randy Phillips.  Mr. Phillips is a Partner at the Mintz Group \\nand heads its Beijing office and many of its other Asian operations. \\n Mr. Phillips spent 28 years with the CIA, ultimately serving as the chief CIA \\nrepresentative in China.  He has also served as vice chairman of the American Chamber of \\nCommerce in China.   \\n Mr. Phillips will provide testimony on U.S. companies\\' participation in the Belt \\nand Road Initiative and identify the opportunities and the risks that U.S. companies face. \\n So let\\'s begin, and I\\'d like to remind the witnesses to keep your remarks to seven \\nminutes and that will give us time for questions and answers. \\n Ms. Rolland, please begin. \\n \\n  \\n\\n1212\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF NADÈGE ROLLAND, SENIOR FELLOW FOR \\nPOLITICAL AND SECURITY AFFAIRS, NATIONAL BUREAU OF ASIAN \\n\\nRESEARCH \\n\\nMS. ROLLAND:  Thank you very much, Commissioner Tobin, Commissioner Shea. \\nI\\'d like to start by thanking the Commission and its staff for inviting me to testify \\n\\nas part of today\\'s hearing.  It\\'s an honor to be here and a privilege to share this panel with \\nJonathan and Randal. \\n\\nIt would take a little bit more than the five minutes and 45 seconds that I now \\nhave to unwrap what Xi Jinping has himself called the \"project of the century.\"  As a matter of \\nfact, it took me over a couple of years of research to try to understand it and a couple of hundred \\npages to try to describe and explain it. \\n\\nSo I thought that today I would kindly invite you to refer to my written testimony \\nregarding what the Belt and Road Initiative is all about and what purposes it serves from \\nBeijing\\'s perspective, and I would like to focus more specifically on a few questions raised by \\nthe Commission staff in preparation for this hearing, as well as on a few points I think might be \\nhelpful to keep in mind throughout the day as you listen to my distinguished colleagues\\' \\ntestimonies. \\n\\nSo I would like to make four main points. The first, BRI is not just about \\ninfrastructure.  Second, it\\'s not just about economics.  Third, it\\'s just beginning to take shape.  \\nAnd fourth, Beijing is deadly serious about it. \\n\\nSo let me elaborate on each of these points.  First, BRI is generally perceived as \\nan infrastructure project.  It\\'s true, but it\\'s not just that.  It\\'s really a comprehensive vision for a \\nregional, political, economic and financial integration under Beijing\\'s helm--a region that \\ncomprises two-thirds of the world\\'s population and half of the world\\'s current GDP.  And as \\nChina makes inroads in this vast region, it\\'s inevitably going to reshape the region\\'s economic \\nand strategic landscape. \\n\\nSecond, BRI is the Chinese leadership\\'s answer to China\\'s most pressing \\neconomic and strategic challenges.  It\\'s not just about economic development.  It\\'s also about \\nsocial stability.  It\\'s about securing China\\'s continental periphery. It\\'s about energy security as \\nwell as broader political influence and strategic expansion.  So it\\'s got many different layers. \\n\\nThird, regarding its progress to date, it\\'s just beginning to take shape really.  There \\nis no official list of projects or countries involved. There is no official map.  The contours of BRI \\nappear very amorphous and flexible.  It includes older and new projects, some of which were \\nunderway before 2013 when Xi Jinping announced it, some of which are only partially funded by \\nChina.  All of this makes it very difficult to really pin it down. \\n\\nDifficulties have also emerged in several countries, most recently Pakistan, Nepal \\nand Bangladesh, but nobody, including China\\'s strategic planners, expect it to go smoothly until \\n2049.  Beijing is very aware of the potential hurdles and is working hard to find solutions to \\novercome them. \\n\\nFourth, and my last point, one thing is clear: it\\'s China\\'s level of commitment to \\nmake it work.  BRI is Xi Jinping\\'s baby, and if we believe that he is as powerful as worldwide \\nexperts say he is, there\\'s a big chance that the rest of the Chinese system is doing everything it \\ncan to make it happen and succeed.  Or, at a minimum, that it bears fruit.   \\n\\nThe commitment that China is attaching to BRI has translated in several ways.  \\nIt\\'s now written in the 19th Communist Party Charter, and thus it sets the overall direction for the \\n\\n1313\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nParty\\'s agenda and efforts in years to come.  It\\'s a long-term effort.  Beijing has mobilized a large \\narray of national resources to support BRI--political, financial, diplomatic, economic, \\nintellectual, et cetera--and the efforts are coordinated at the very top by a Leading Small Group \\nthat is staffed by Politburo members and on a day-to-day basis by the NDRC, the National \\nDevelopment Reform Commission. \\n\\nAll of China\\'s major economic and development plans--the 13th Five-Year Plan, \\nthe Made in China 2025, the Internet Plus Strategy--all of them overlap and dovetail with Belt \\nand Road. \\n\\nAnd, yes, there\\'s a certain degree of improvisation and flexibility in the way BRI \\nis unfolding, but these are just I think the characteristics of a system that works differently than \\nours and relies more on the propensity of things than on a step-by-step plan and program.  It does \\nnot mean that it is stupid or irrelevant. \\n\\nAs a conclusion, I would like to underline that BRI\\'s intangible manifestations are \\nas important, if not more, than its actual physical development.  It is the multi-layered web of \\npolitical, economic, educational, industrial and security ties that China is developing with the \\ndeveloping world and that China is weaving right under our eyes that will shape tomorrow\\'s \\nEurasian economic and geostrategic landscape. \\n\\nThe objective is an unrivaled Chinese influence over a key region of the world.  \\nThis is what really is at stake with Belt and Road.  This is what the Chinese regime is determined \\nto achieve, and this is why we need to take it very seriously. \\n\\nThank you very much for your attention. \\n\\n1414\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF NADÈGE ROLLAND, SENIOR FELLOW FOR \\nPOLITICAL AND SECURITY AFFAIRS, NATIONAL BUREAU OF ASIAN \\n\\nRESEARCH \\n\\n1515\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \\nHearing on: “China’s Belt and Road Initiative: Five Years Later” \\n\\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\nNadège Rolland \\nSenior Fellow, The National Bureau of Asian Research \\n\\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is generally understood as China’s plan to finance and build \\ninfrastructure projects across Eurasia. Infrastructure development is in fact only one of BRI’s \\nfive components which include strengthened regional political cooperation, unimpeded trade, \\nfinancial integration and people-to-people exchanges. Taken together, BRI’s different \\ncomponents serve Beijing’s vision for regional integration under its helm. It is a top-level \\ndesign for which the central government has mobilized the country’s political, diplomatic, \\nintellectual, economic and financial resources. It is mainly conceived as a response to the most \\npressing internal and external economic and strategic challenges faced by China, and as an \\ninstrument at the service of the PRC’s vision for itself as the uncontested leading power in the \\nregion in the coming decades. As such, it is a grand strategy1.  \\n\\n1. Belt and Road: What is It?\\n\\nThe Belt and Road Initiative was not announced as such five years ago, but in two separate \\nspeeches given by Xi Jinping: the first in Astana in September 2013, announcing China’s \\nwillingness to create a Silk Road Economic Belt stretching across land from China to Europe; \\nthe second in Jakarta in October 2013, mentioning China’s desire to launch its equivalent at \\nsea, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Both proposals rapidly got combined under the \\nabbreviation “One Belt, One Road,” an English translation officially replaced in 2015 by “Belt \\nand Road Initiative” (BRI), supposedly to counter the impression that China owned the concept \\nand to reflect its willingness to welcome others’ participation. The basic idea is that \\ninfrastructure building (roads, railways, port facilities, pipelines, fiber optic and IT networks) \\nacross Eurasia will bring economic development to a large region spanning East to West from \\nChina’s eastern shores to Europe via Russia, Central Asia, South Asia and the Middle-East, and \\nfrom China’s southern shores to Southeast Asia, the Indian ocean rim, the Persian Gulf and the \\nMediterranean. This is a vast region mainly composed of emerging markets and rising middle \\nclasses and which, taken together, accounts for two thirds of the world population and over half \\nof the global GDP.  \\n\\nSince 2014, BRI has rapidly materialized through: \\n\\n• promises of Chinese investments with amounts oscillating between $1 and 1.3 trillion\\ndollars, backed, among others, by the creation of new financial mechanisms such as the\\nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank (proposed in October 2013, officially opened in\\nJanuary 2016) and the Silk Road Fund (created in 2014);\\n\\n• an intense high-level round of Chinese diplomatic engagement, supported by a forceful\\npropaganda campaign relayed by Chinese scholars and media around the globe, and\\ncrowned by the Belt and Road International Forum held in Beijing in May 2017;\\n\\n1 This testimony draws on the conclusions and research findings of my book, China’s Eurasian Century? \\nPolitical and Strategic Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative, NBR, 2017. \\n\\n16Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n• the successful initiation of an impressive array of projects extending across the\\ncontinental and maritime domain.\\n\\nSparing no modesty for a plan he personally designed with a handful of close advisors, Xi \\nJinping hailed BRI as the “project of the Century.” If successful, BRI certainly has the potential \\nto fundamentally change the economic and strategic geography of the region. \\n\\n2. What Purpose Does It Serve?\\n\\nEven though BRI is officially portrayed and projected outside China as an economic endeavor \\nthat is meant for the benefit of the entire region, the internal discussions related to the project \\nreveal it is mostly intended to serve China’s interests and objectives, both in the economic and \\nstrategic domains.  \\n\\n• On the economic side,\\n\\nBRI should be understood, at least partly, as a new stimulus package for the Chinese economy \\nwhose last double-digit growth was recorded in 2010. Right after the 2008 global financial \\ncrisis, the Chinese government quickly launched a $586 billion stimulus package, heavily \\ninvesting in domestic infrastructure projects in order to help sustain growth. This measure only \\nhad a short-lived positive effect. The government needed to find another solution to be able to \\nhit its self-imposed target of doubling GDP and per capita income between 2010 and 2020. \\nFrom the regime perspective though, a thorough transformation of the country’s economic \\ndevelopment model towards domestic consumption and private initiative would have come at \\nunacceptable political cost. Instead of veering towards such a transformation, the government \\ndecided to rely once again on its preferred model, stimulating growth through investment, \\nexports and subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), operating outside of China on a \\nregional scale, via BRI.  \\n\\nBuilding infrastructure across Eurasia would also have the double advantage of helping to get \\nrid of some of China’s excess industrial capacity that had been created by the 2008 stimulus \\npackage, while further supporting the state conglomerates’ “going global” strategy. Funded by \\nChinese policy banks (Eximbank, China Development Bank) and staffed by Chinese workers, \\nregional infrastructure projects would predominantly become the preserve of China’s SOEs \\n(China State Construction Engineering, China Railway Construction, State Grid, China \\nMerchants, etc.), opening new markets for them and helping them build and scale a truly global \\nfootprint. Finally, it was hoped that BRI would help increase regional e-commerce and cross-\\nborder transactions conducted in renminbi, thus accelerating the Chinese currency’s \\ninternationalization.  \\n\\n• Beyond the supposed multiple economic gains BRI would bring to China, its architects\\nalso believe it will help reap substantial political and geostrategic benefits for their\\ncountry.\\n\\nFirst among these, and consistent with what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has tried to \\ndo for almost two decades albeit with uneven results, the hope is that more investment in \\nregional infrastructure will help reduce the development gap between China’s coastal and inner \\nprovinces. Sandwiched between its own eastern urbanized dynamic coastal poles, and emerging \\neconomies with increasing potential outside of its western and southern borders, China’s \\nlandlocked provinces lag behind in term of economic development. Development and enhanced \\n\\n17Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nliving standards are seen by Beijing as key factors to reduce the risk of social unrest and political \\ninstability. They are also seen as the best ways to discourage religious radicalization, \\nfundamentalism, and terrorist recruitment - both within China’s borders and beyond.  \\n\\nSecond, the acceleration of investments in infrastructure induced by BRI would enable Beijing \\nto tackle another of its recurrent anxieties, this time related to its energy security. For years, \\nBeijing has been uneasy at the thought that its energy imports transit through sea lanes of \\ncommunication that are under the protection and surveillance of the U.S. Navy including in the \\nSouth China Sea. Beijing has been looking for alternative routes to circumvent the so-called \\n“Malacca Strait dilemma” and diversify its supplies through land routes. The projected and \\ncurrent BRI projects illustrate an attempt to redraw the map of China’s energy supply routes \\nfrom Iran, the Gulf countries and eastern Africa, while increasing its imports from Russia and \\nCentral Asia. Traveling by sea/land pipelines through Pakistan and Myanmar, or directly by \\nland across Eurasia, some of China’s energy imports would thus bypass the South China Sea, \\nreducing the risk of being cut by a potential American naval blockade in case of a military \\nconflict.   \\n\\nLastly, China’s financial, political and diplomatic investment in BRI does not come out of a \\nheartfelt Chinese commitment to serve the common good. In return for its largess, China \\nexpects to get some concrete geopolitical benefits for itself. BRI’s architects are blurring the \\nlines between economy and strategy, and intend to use economic power as an instrument for \\nstrategic purposes.2 Instead of gunboat diplomacy and coercive military power, the PRC intends \\nto use BRI to access new markets, get a hold on to critical infrastructure assets, and influence \\nregional countries’ strategic decisions. Economic leverage will be used both as an incentive to \\ngarner support for its interests and reduce potential resistance, and as a means to punish \\nrecalcitrant countries.  \\n\\nBeijing expects that its plan will help “expand its circle of friends” - in other words, strengthen \\nits influence in a vast area where democratic practice is weak, authoritarian regimes mostly \\nprevail, and where the US influence is rather limited. In this region, as in countries facing \\nincreasing waves of discontent against globalization, there is a real prospect that following the \\n“China model” could become increasingly appealing. Liberal democratic ideals and standards \\nthat the U.S., together with its European and Asian allies, have been trying to promote over the \\nregion as part of their shared post-Cold War vision of an “open and free” Eurasian continent,3 \\nwill likely come under increasing threat as BRI’s standards (or lack thereof) spread across this \\nvast region.  \\n\\nUnder Xi Jinping, China has been increasingly vocal about its dissatisfaction with the current \\nworld order. During his 19th Party Congress speech last October, Xi presented China’s path as \\n“a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while \\npreserving their independence.”4 Starting with the countries included along the Belt and Road \\nthat Xi purports to include in a “community of common destiny,” the PRC now offers a recipe \\n\\n2 Professor Shi Yinhong calls this “strategic economy.” See his paper, “China’s Complicated Foreign Policy,” \\nECFR Commentary, March 31, 2015, \\nhttp://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_chinas_complicated_foreign_policy311562. \\n3 After the end of the Cold War, several Western countries tried to promote infrastructure interconnectivity and \\neconomic development in the hope that prosperity would transform post-Communist Eurasia into a democratized \\nand peaceful region. \\n4 “Full Text of Xi Jinping’s Report at the 19th CPC National Congress,” Xinhua, November 4, 2017, \\nhttp://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/19thcpcnationalcongress/2017-11/04/content_34115212.htm \\n\\n18Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nfor stability and prosperity, just like the one it has used for itself, and it is trying to convince \\nthe rest of the world that the Chinese way is the way of the future.  \\n\\n3. Internal Mobilization\\n\\nBRI is meant to improve both China’s economic situation and its security environment in order \\nto realize Xi Jinping’s “China dream of the great rejuvenation of the nation.” It is the organizing \\nconcept of Xi’s vision for China as a rising global power with unique national characteristics. \\nIt sets the general long-term direction for China and seeks to mobilize and coordinate the use \\nof all available national resources (political, economic, diplomatic, military and ideological) to \\npursue internal (economic development, social stability) and external (foreign policy, national \\nsecurity) objectives in an integrated way. As such, it is a grand strategy that is meant to serve \\nChina’s unimpeded rise to great power status. \\n\\nBecause there exists no official map, no detailed publicly available list of projects, priorities, \\nplans or even targeted countries, no Belt and Road “national task force,” no Belt and Road \\n“special representative” or general secretary, some observers have dismissed BRI as empty talk. \\nBut a closer look at the inner workings of the Chinese system reveals a high degree of vertical \\ncoordination for the initiative domestically. Such a mobilization effort reflects the priority \\nattached to it by the central government. The top-level plan trickles down to all bureaucratic \\nlevels:  \\n\\n• The idea was conceived by Xi Jinping and his closest advisors, including Wang Huning,\\nbefore he came to power in November 2012.\\n\\n• On March 28, 2015, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC),\\njointly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce issued a\\ndocument entitled “Vision and Actions on Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt\\nand 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.” The document reads more like a general\\nroadmap than a concrete and detailed proposal, but is the first attempt to give the outside\\nworld some sense about the government’s vision.\\n\\n• Also in March 2015, a central leading small group on “advancing the development of\\nthe belt and road” was set up, staffed by five Politburo members, indicating the central\\nleadership’s determination to coordinate all aspects of the initiative and oversee its\\nimplementation at the highest level. The day-to-day management and coordination work\\nwith relevant ministries and entities has been assigned to the NDRC, which is hosting\\nan “Office of the leading group” for BRI.\\n\\n• BRI seminars, workshops and study sessions are regularly being held at intermediary\\nlevels of the bureaucracy so that the information gets circulated to all relevant entities.5\\n\\nThrough its in-house think-tank (the China Center for Contemporary World Studies,\\nCCCWS), the CCP’s International Liaison Department acts as the national secretariat\\nfor research activities related to BRI, both inside China and with foreign think-tanks\\nalong the Belt and Road. Scholarly exchanges, seminars and conferences organized\\n\\n5 See for example, “Maritime Silk Road \"Belt and Road\" Seminar Held in Hainan Marine Police Training Base, \\nWeChat, January 8, 2018, accessed at  \\nhttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-QnrH9P5bFAf_Zl1EnY6lQ, “Ou Xiaoli: China Does Not Impose any Political \\nStandard on ‘Belt and Road’ Cooperation,” Caijing, November 30, 2017, accessed at  \\nhttp://finance.sina.com.cn/meeting/2017-11-30/doc-ifypceiq8353251.shtml, and “Zhang Gaoli: Advancing the \\nConstruction of Belt and Road by Persevering in Joint Discussions, Joint Building and Joint Development ; \\nCreating a New Pattern of Linkages between Land-Sea and East-West,” Xinhua, January 15, 2016, accessed at \\nhttp://www.chinatax.gov.cn/n810219/n810744/n1671176/n1671181/c2003599/content.html \\n\\n19Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\ndomestically and around the world, are supposed to “provide sustained intellectual \\nsupport” and “promote better understanding” of BRI in wider audiences.6 \\n\\n• Five additional documents, including some specifically dedicated to the maritime,\\nenergy, agriculture, and green cooperation along Belt and Road countries, have been\\npublished in 2017.7\\n\\n• During the October 2017 19th CCP Congress, BRI was incorporated into the Party\\ncharter. This latest addition shows the overall direction given to the Party in its efforts\\nto make progress on the BRI front for the upcoming five years.\\n\\nIn addition, BRI has been integrated into the 13th Five-Year plan (2016-2020) and dovetails \\nthe “Made in China 2025” plan and China’s “Internet Plus” strategy:  \\n\\n• The 13th Five Year plan devotes a chapter to BRI and gives “high priority to\\nimplementing the strategy for the large-scale development” of China’s inland\\nprovinces.8 Xinjiang is named in the document as the core area of the Silk Road\\nEconomic Belt, and Fujian as the core of the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road, but the\\noverall objective is to make sure all of China’s most backward provinces benefit from\\ngreater economic opportunities offered by enhanced cross-border trade.\\n\\n• Meanwhile, the “Made in China 2025” plan released in May 2015 aims, among other\\nobjectives, at upgrading the PRC’s 10 key high-tech industries, five of which are\\ndirectly related to BRI’s development: aviation and aerospace, electrical power, next\\ngeneration information technologies, rail transportation and marine technologies.\\n\\n• Finally, China’s “Internet Plus” strategy, announced in March 2015 with the intent of\\nfostering a strong domestic high-tech digital sector (mobile Internet, cloud computing,\\nbig data and Internet of Things) also overlaps with BRI’s pledge to support “e-\\ncommerce, digital economy, smart cities and science and technology parks” in Belt and\\nRoad countries9 as part of the Chinese government’s vision of a “Silk Road in\\ncyberspace” that will materialize through the building of IT networks (subterranean and\\nsubsea fiber-optic cables, Beidou satellite coverage), increased regional e-commerce\\nand even “exchanges in cyber culture.” A document issued in March 2017 on China’s\\n“International Strategy of Cooperation in Cyberspace” officially calls domestic Internet\\ncompanies to “take the lead in going global,” and specifically mentions BRI when it\\nencourages them to “explore international market and build cross-border industrial\\n\\n6 He Na, “Think Tank to Support Belt and Road Initiative,” China Daily, February 24, 2016, accessed at \\nhttp://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-02/24/content_23617083.htm    \\n7 “Building the Belt and Road: Concept, Practice and China’s Contribution,” Office of the Leading Group for the \\nBelt and Road Initiative, May 2017, accessed at \\nhttps://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/wcm.files/upload/CMSydylyw/201705/201705110537027.pdf ; “Vision for \\nMaritime Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative,” June 20, 2017, accessed at \\nhttp://english.gov.cn/archive/publications/2017/06/20/content_281475691873460.htm ; “Vision and Action on \\nJointly Promoting Agricultural Cooperation on the Belt and Road,” May 2017, accessed at \\nhttp://english.agri.gov.cn/news/dqnf/201705/t20170512_247847.htm; “Vision and Actions on Energy \\nCooperation in Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road,” accessed at \\nhttps://www.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/wcm.files/upload/CMSydylgw/201705/201705161049036.pdf ; “Guidance on \\nPromoting Green Belt and Road,” May 2017, accessed at https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/zchj/qwfb/12479.htm. \\n8 “The 13th Five Year Plan for Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China (2016-\\n2020),” accessed at http://en.ndrc.gov.cn/newsrelease/201612/P020161207645765233498.pdf  \\n9 “Joint Communiqué of Leaders Roundtable of Belt and Road Forum,” Xinhua, May 15, 2017, accessed at \\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/15/c_136286378.htm \\n\\n20Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nchain, (…) actively engage in capacity building of other countries and help developing \\ncountries” with several e-sectors in order “to contribute to their social development.”10 \\n\\n4. Five Years Later: Is It Real?\\n\\nEven more difficult to find than a detailed BRI plan laid out by Beijing, is a list of projects that \\nhave actually come to life since 2013. During the May 2017 Belt and Road Forum, the Chinese \\ngovernment published a “list of deliverables” purporting to show that over 270 “concrete \\nresults” had been achieved in each of the five BRI areas, but mostly listing MoUs and \\ncooperation documents signed with the UN, national governments, and relevant agencies within \\nBelt and Road countries.11 Some Chinese governmental sources have pointed out that about 50 \\nSOEs “have invested or participated in nearly 1,700 projects in countries along the new Silk \\nRoad routes over the past three years.”12 It is nevertheless a challenge to pin them down, partly \\nbecause some of these projects were discussed, decided upon and/or were underway before \\n2013 (for example, Gwadar started in 2002, Hambantota in 2008), others have been announced \\nwith MoUs signed and promises of investment made, but have not yet sprung from the ground. \\nSometimes, the amounts of investment promised do not add up or China seems to have been \\npromising the same amount several times over the years. Some projects have been started by \\nother countries but funded either partially or totally by China, or have been announced by China \\nbut funded partially by non-Chinese financial institutions (such as ERDB, ADB and the World \\nBank). Should these also be counted as Belt and Road projects?  \\n\\nBRI is a work in progress, still in its early phase, with a completion date set by Beijing for the \\nmid-21st Century. Cross-border infrastructure projects are some of the most difficult to \\nimplement as they require complex and often protracted negotiations over proposed routes, \\ndevelopment rights, financing and investment returns. After all, it took the UN Economic and \\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) almost 15 years between the \\nlaunching of its Asian Land Transportation Infrastructure Program in 1992 and the signing of \\nintergovernmental agreements on the Asian Highway Network (2003) and Trans-Asian \\nRailway Network (2006). In contrast, it took China less than five years to launch and operate a \\nmultilateral financial institution (AIIB), and to create global momentum around Eurasian \\ninfrastructure building. No head of State or government across the large geographic area \\nincluded in BRI has not heard about the Chinese initiative, included BRI in their diplomatic \\nagendas for dialogues with Chinese counterparts, paid careful attention Beijing’s promises of \\ncapital and of a new type of “mutually beneficial cooperation,” and started to think about how \\ntheir country could benefit from it, one way or another. What country, other than China, shows \\nas much consistency and apparent dedication in its political, diplomatic and financial \\ncommitment to such a complex, diverse, unstable, and conflicted region, one that has been \\nstruggling for years to achieve economic development?  \\n\\nYes, difficulties have emerged. Pakistan and Nepal, for example, have recently announced that \\nthey are reconsidering some BRI projects, because of unacceptable financing conditions in the \\n\\n10 “International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cyberspace \\nAdministration of China, March 02, 2017, accessed at http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-\\n03/02/content_28410278.htm \\n11 “List of Deliverables of Belt and Road Forum,” Xinhua, May 15, 2017, accessed at \\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/15/c_136286376.htm  \\n12 Wu Gang, “SOEs Lead Infrastructure Push in 1,700 ‘Belt and Road’ Projects,” Caixin, May 9, 2017, accessed \\nat https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-05-10/101088332.html \\n\\n21Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nfirst instance and irregularities in the bidding process in the second.13 BRI will probably \\nencounter more setbacks in the future, including local resistance to Beijing’s financial \\nconditions, an influx of Chinese manpower, or potentially harmful environmental impacts. But \\nthe Chinese government is well aware of the potential obstacles that lie ahead, and is working \\nhard to anticipate and overcome them.  \\n\\nAnd yes, there’s a certain degree of improvisation and flexibility in the way BRI is unfolding; \\nbut that doesn’t mean it is not real. These characteristics are just a reflection of a system that \\nworks differently than ours. Assessments of success based on calculations of economic returns, \\nquantifiable results and objective performance criteria, are not the most important and may not \\neven be relevant in cases where projects have clearly been chosen, not for their economic \\nprofitability, but rather out of geopolitical motives.  \\n\\nThe intangible manifestations of BRI are as important, if not more, than its actual concrete \\nphysical progress. With BRI, Beijing is not only strengthening its image as a truly global power, \\nit is also developing a multi-layered web of political, economic, educational, industrial, and \\nsecurity ties with two-thirds of the world’s population, sowing seeds that will shape tomorrow’s \\nEurasian economic and geopolitical landscape. After all, BRI’s success is not going to be \\ncounted in miles of railways laid on the ground, nor in pounds of steel exported to emerging \\nmarkets, but in increased Chinese influence and possible domination over a key region of the \\nworld. This is what is at stake. This is what the Chinese regime is so determined to achieve. \\nThis is why we need to take BRI seriously.  \\n\\n5.

HILLMAN:  Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. \\nIn keeping with the panel\\'s theme, I will focus on the Belt and Road\\'s economic \\n\\ndimensions.  Very briefly, I\\'d like to just touch on four areas: first, key trends in Belt and Road \\nprojects; second, China\\'s tools for advancing the Belt and Road; third, the Belt and Road\\'s \\neconomic and political impacts; and also implications for the United States. \\n\\nAs has been mentioned, I think the Belt and Road is probably the best known but \\nleast understood foreign policy effort underway today.  And for all the attention it receives, \\nthere\\'s little reliable information about how it\\'s unfolding in aggregate. \\n\\nA major challenge is that the BRI label evades classification, both geographically, \\ntemporally, functionally, and I think by design, the BRI is really a vision and in some cases a \\nloose brand more than it is a masterplan with strict criteria for inclusion. \\n\\nInfrastructure is not the only component of the Belt and Road, but it is a major \\ncomponent, and I think it\\'s important in that it provides a window into the Belt and Road\\'s \\ndrivers and broader implications.  And for the past three years, CSIS has been tracking \\ninfrastructure projects across the Eurasian supercontinent. \\n\\nWe have a database of about 2,200 projects--transportation projects--that include \\nnot only Chinese-funded projects but what others are doing in the region, and as that database \\ngrows, several trends are emerging.  I\\'ll just note one of them that has I think both economic and \\npolitical implications. \\n\\nSo one major question about the Belt and Road is its openness, you know the \\ndegree to which others can participate and benefit from it.  And our data to date suggests that \\nChinese projects are less open to local and international participation. \\n\\nOut of all the contractors participating in Chinese-funded projects within our \\ndatabase, about 89 percent are Chinese companies, about seven percent are local companies, \\nmeaning that they\\'re headquartered in the same country where the project is taking place, and \\nabout three percent are foreign companies so non-Chinese companies from a country other than \\nthe one in which the project was taking place. \\n\\nThe mix of contractors for projects funded by the World Bank and Asian \\nDevelopment Bank is much more evenly distributed, and I think this finding, while not shocking \\nto those of us who follow this, it does remind us that despite official rhetoric about the Belt and \\nRoad being open and global, it is, I think, first and foremost, a Chinese-centric effort.   \\n\\nThese trends could change over time, as has been mentioned.  This is a very long-\\nterm initiative, and it\\'s also possible that Western firms are more competitive in other areas such \\nas providing consulting and legal services. \\n\\nAnd I think over the longer term even China stands to benefit from greater \\ntransparency and openness.  Right now, there is I think genuine interest among U.S. and other \\nWestern firms in participating in Belt and Road related projects, but unless more opportunities \\nare made for them to do so, I think that interest will wane and suspicion will rise. \\n\\nChina uses several tools to boost its exports, many of them now falling under the \\nBelt and Road banner: national champions; credit; infrastructure; and trade agreements.  I think \\n\\n2323\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nwe could spend an entire hearing discussing any one of those but what\\'s I think equally important \\nis how China is bringing those tools together. \\n\\nIts approach is what I think is both centralized but flexible.  It\\'s centralized in that \\nwhen a recipient country receives an offer from China, it often interacts with all the key actors \\nwho present a more unified front, and this is in contrast to the traditional Western approach, \\nwhich involves dealing separately with a wider range of less coordinated actors. \\n\\nChina is also flexible because it\\'s willing to work with any government.  It\\'s \\nwilling to build to budget and with less stringent requirements for meeting safeguards, and it\\'s \\nwilling to accept often a broader range of payment terms. \\n\\nI think this approach magnifies the short-term incentives for starting projects, but \\nI think it also masks some long-term risks. \\n\\nThe BRI\\'s political and economic impacts I think could be even, even \\ncontradictory over the longer term.  Right now I think we see evidence of the Belt and Road\\'s \\npolitical success, but over the long term that political impact will depend on implementation of \\nthese projects. \\n\\nSo politically--I think this will be covered later today--China is already becoming \\ncloser with traditional partners like Pakistan.  It\\'s making deeper ties and inroads with countries \\nfurther west such as those in Eastern and Central Europe.  Several countries have announced \\ntheir intentions to link their own development strategies with the Belt and Road.  \\n\\nBut economically and politically, the Belt and Road also faces some near-term \\nconstraints and longer-term challenges.  When smaller economies do business with China, I \\nthink we need to remember that they\\'re not directly aligning themselves.  They\\'re often trying to \\nbalance.  And so, you know, you see a competition that is emerging not only between--it\\'s not \\njust China, but there are other regional actors who are quite involved--Japan, India, Russia, \\nothers, South Korea. \\n\\nNot all of the Belt and Road\\'s political impacts have been positive to date.  I think \\nthere is an emerging gap between expectations among countries who have joined the Initiative \\nand the benefits that they\\'ve received for doing so. \\n\\nAnd over time, I think that support for the Belt and Road could change depending \\non how it\\'s implemented.  It could decline and even turn against China.  We need to remember \\nthat large infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time, on budget and with their promised \\nbenefits, even in the best business environments, and so when projects disappoint for any reason, \\nwhich they I think will inevitably do so over the coming years, China stands to suffer some \\nreputational damage.  And it\\'s possible that what looks like boldness today could look like hubris \\nin two decades. \\n\\nThe United States has a range of economic interests at stake, and I\\'m hoping we \\ncan maybe discuss a bit of that today.  I think there\\'s the obvious commercial interest.  There\\'s \\nalso a longer-term broader economic interest in the stability of major systems--trade, finance, \\nand so on. \\n\\nAnd I think that a Belt and Road that succeeds on China\\'s terms would revise \\nthose systems to reflect Chinese interests.  A Belt and Road that fails would also have \\nconsequences for the U.S. that would not be positive.  I think, you know, a Belt and Road that \\nfails spectacularly could harm regional growth, and that would have implications for us as well. \\n\\nSo I will leave it there, and I look forward to unpacking some more of that further.  \\nThank you. \\n\\n2424\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF JONATHAN HILLMAN \\nFELLOW AND DIRECTOR, RECONNECTING ASIA PROJECT, CENTER FOR \\n\\nSTRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES \\n\\n2525\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n1 \\n\\n Statement Before the \\nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\\n\\n“China’s Belt and Road Initiative: Five Years Later” \\n\\nA Testimony by: \\n\\nJonathan Hillman \\n\\nFellow, Simon Chair in Political Economy, and Director, Reconnecting \\n\\nAsia Project  \\n\\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\n419 Dirksen Senate Office Building \\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n2 \\n\\nIntroduction \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to testify on China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its \\n\\nimplications for U.S. interests. The Commission asked me to focus on the BRI’s economic \\n\\ndimensions. I will address four key questions in this regard: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 What are the key trends in BRI projects to date, and to what extent do BRI projects\\n\\nfollow market rules and international standards?\\n\\n\\uf0b7 What tools has Beijing used to boost Chinese exports under the BRI?\\n\\n\\uf0b7 How has the BRI affected China’s trade and investment patterns, its diplomatic reach,\\n\\nand its soft power?\\n\\n\\uf0b7 What are the economic implications of the BRI for the United States?\\n\\nAfter addressing these questions, I will conclude with brief recommendations for Congressional \\n\\naction.  \\n\\nHot Spots and Blind Spots: Key Trends in BRI Projects \\n\\nThe BRI is the most ambitious geoeconomic vision in recent history. Spanning some 70 \\n\\ncountries, it can claim to cover more than two-thirds of the world’s population. It could include \\n\\nChinese investments approaching $4 trillion.1 It intends to strengthen hard infrastructure with \\n\\nnew roads and railways, soft infrastructure with trade and transportation agreements, and even \\n\\ncultural ties with university scholarships and other people-to-people exchanges. In all these \\n\\nways, when much of the West is looking inward, China is connecting with the world. \\n\\nThe BRI is also the best-known, least-understood foreign policy effort underway. Beyond \\n\\ninvestments in actual projects, China spends significant resources organizing BRI events, \\n\\npromoting BRI stories, and conducting other outreach. Recognition within and outside China has \\n\\nbeen growing. Chinese state media claim that global awareness of the BRI has tripled between \\n\\n2014 and 2017, increasing from 6 percent to 18 percent in a survey of 22 countries.2 Nearly 30 \\n\\nworld leaders and representatives from 110 countries and international organizations attended the \\n\\nBRI Forum in May 2017. The event, hosted by President Xi Jinping, received significant global \\n\\ncoverage. Attention and awareness continues to climb, especially in the West. In recent weeks, \\n\\nthe Financial Times,3 the New York Times,4 and other international outlets have all included \\n\\nreporting on BRI-related projects.    \\n\\n1 “Our bulldozers, our rules,” The Economist, July 2, 2016. https://www.economist.com/news/china/21701505-\\n\\nchinas-foreign-policy-could-reshape-good-part-world-economy-our-bulldozers-our-rules. Some estimates for fully \\n\\nimplementing the BRI are even higher, reaching $8 trillion.  \\n2 Martin Guo, “2016-2017 China National Image Global Survey,” Kantar, January 11, 2018. \\n\\nhttps://us.kantar.com/business/brands/2018/2016-2017-china-national-image-global-survey/  \\n3 Emily Feng, “China-Kazakhstan border woes dent Silk Road ambitions,” Financial Times, December 20, 2017. \\n\\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/1606d70a-9c31-11e7-8cd4-932067fbf946  \\n4 Andrew Higgins, “China’s Ambitious New Port: Landlocked Kazakhstan,” New York Times, January 1, 2018. \\n\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/world/asia/china-kazakhstan-silk-road.html  \\n\\n27\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n3 \\n\\nBut for all the attention the BRI receives, there is little reliable information about how it is \\n\\nunfolding in aggregate. A major challenge is that the BRI label evades classification. There is no \\n\\nagreed-upon definition for what qualifies as a BRI project.5 There are roughly 70 countries \\n\\nparticipating in the BRI, according to Chinese state media. Yet there are Chinese-funded projects \\n\\nin non-participant countries that share many of the same characteristics. The BRI was officially \\n\\nlaunched in November 2013, but projects started years earlier are often counted. The BRI banner \\n\\nhangs over a wide and ever-expanding list of activities. There are BRI fashion shows, concerts, \\n\\nand art exhibits. By design, the BRI is more a loose brand than a program with strict criteria.   \\n\\nInfrastructure is a major component of the BRI and provides a window into its drivers and \\n\\nbroader implications. For three years, the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic \\n\\nand International Studies (CSIS) has been tracking infrastructure projects across the Eurasian \\n\\nsupercontinent. Our website, ReconnectingAsia.CSIS.org, has an interactive map, an open-\\n\\nsource database of over 2,200 transportation projects, and expert analysis. To date, this database \\n\\nhas focused on transportation projects: road, railroads, seaports, and dry ports. It will expand in \\n\\nthe future to include power plants, pipelines, telecommunications, and other connectivity \\n\\ninfrastructure. China is not the only focal point of this database, which covers all funders, but it \\n\\nis the most active. \\n\\nAs this database grows, several trends are emerging. First, China is often the biggest spender, but \\n\\nit is not the only consequential actor. Across the Eurasian supercontinent, three zones of \\n\\ncompetition are emerging. In Southeast Asia, Japan is outspending China in several countries. In \\n\\nCentral Asia, the Asian Development Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDB) \\n\\nhave significant activities underway. In Eastern and Central Europe, European funders remain \\n\\ndominant in many countries. To be sure, this is not a zero-sum contest, and there are numerous \\n\\nprojects with both Chinese and MDB funding. These areas will be important to watch as China \\n\\ncontinues to compete with, and adapt to, other visions for connectivity. \\n\\nSecond, Chinese projects are less open to local and international participation. Out of all \\n\\ncontractors participating in Chinese-funded projects within the Reconnecting Asia database, 89 \\n\\npercent are Chinese companies, 7.6 percent are local companies (companies headquartered in the \\n\\nsame country where the project was taking place), and 3.4 percent are foreign companies (non-\\n\\nChinese companies from a country other than the one where the project was taking place). In \\n\\ncomparison, out of the contractors participating in projects funded by the multilateral \\n\\ndevelopment banks, 29 percent are Chinese, 40.8 percent are local, and 30.2 percent are foreign.  \\n\\nThese findings illuminate some difficult practical and political realities. Practically speaking, it \\n\\nshould not come as a surprise that Chinese companies are winning more contracts for Chinese-\\n\\nfunded projects. Despite official rhetoric about the BRI being open and global, it is a China-\\n\\ncentric effort. Chinese companies are also extremely competitive in the transportation sector. It is \\n\\npossible that Western firms are more competitive in providing related services around these \\n\\nprojects, such as consulting and legal services, but further research is needed. China’s advantage \\n\\nalso stems from some of the tools it uses, which are explained further in the next section.  \\n\\n5 Rather than adopt a superficial definition, I use the phrase “BRI-related project” broadly to describe infrastructure \\n\\nprojects with Chinese funding.  \\n\\n28Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n4 \\n\\nThird, Chinese projects are less transparent at earlier stages of the project lifecycle. The \\n\\nReconnecting Asia Project recently ran an experiment that scored the project pages in our \\n\\ndatabase for completeness. Projects with more data fields completed received more points. \\n\\nScoring was adjusted based on the project status. A project that is just under negotiation, for \\n\\nexample, would not be expected to have as much information as a completed project. We found \\n\\nno meaningful difference in the amount of information available for Chinese-funded projects \\n\\nversus projects supported by various multilateral development banks. They all scored in the low \\n\\nto mid 80’s out of 100, roughly B’s and B-minuses.  \\n\\nBut transparency is tricky. How do you evaluate projects that you cannot find? To get closer to \\n\\nanswering that question, we examined the status levels for projects in our database. We have six \\n\\nstatus levels – beginning with “announced” and ending with “completed” or “cancelled” – and \\n\\nthere are some projects for which the status is unknown. What jumped out in this comparison \\n\\nbetween MDB projects and projects from the China Development Bank is the difference in early \\n\\nstage projects. About 7 percent of our MDB projects are marked as announced, which is the \\n\\nearliest stage in our database. To date, the database does not have any China Development Bank \\n\\n(CDB) projects in the earliest stage (“announced”), and it has a higher percentage of CDB \\n\\nprojects that are completed. \\n\\nThese trends could change over time. Indeed, it is in everyone’s long-term interest that projects \\n\\nare open and transparent. Greater openness and transparency benefits recipient countries by \\n\\nensuring the companies participating are the best for the job. If there is little or no information \\n\\navailable publicly about early stage projects, it is impossible to have an open and fair \\n\\ncompetition. Even China stands to benefit over the longer term. Right now, U.S. and other \\n\\nWestern firms are genuinely interested in participating in BRI-related projects. But unless there \\n\\nare more opportunities to participate, that interest will wane and suspicion will rise. More \\n\\ncountries will start to ask why they joined the BRI, and those that have not joined will not.  \\n\\nThe Visible Hand: China’s Tools \\n\\nChina uses several tools to boost its exports, many of them now falling under the BRI banner: \\n\\nnational champions, credit, infrastructure, and trade agreements. Chinese state-owned enterprises \\n\\n(SOEs) often benefit from tremendous scale and subsidies. They have dramatically moved up the \\n\\nglobal rankings in recent years. In 2000, Fortune’s Global 500 list of the world’s largest \\n\\ncompanies by revenue included 10 Chinese firms, of which 9 were state-owned. 6 In 2017, the \\n\\nlist included 107 Chinese firms, of which 75 were state-owned. This trend is especially stark in \\n\\nthe construction industry. In 2017, seven of the ten largest construction companies in the world, \\n\\nby revenue, were Chinese.7 When Chinese SOEs compete for foreign contracts, they bring these \\n\\nadvantages to the table. \\n\\n6 “The changing headquarters landscape for Fortune Global 500 companies,” Ernst & Young LLP, October 31, \\n\\n2017. https://taxnews.ey.com/news/2017-1810-the-changing-headquarters-landscape-for-fortune-global-500-\\n\\ncompanies  \\n7 “Top 250 Global Contractors,” Engineering News-Record, August 2017. https://www.enr.com/toplists/2017-Top-\\n\\n250-Global-Contractors-1\\n\\n29Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n5 \\n\\nCredit is a powerful incentive. According to researchers at William and Mary, Chinese lending \\n\\nduring 2000-2014 totaled $354.4 billion, with lending highest in the transport and power \\n\\nsectors.8 Of these loans, about three quarters had commercial terms. China is successful at \\n\\nlocking in higher rates because it agrees to assume risks that other lenders will not. In Sri Lanka, \\n\\nwhich I visited earlier this month, China was willing to provide a $1.3 billion loan for a new port \\n\\nafter MDBs declined. After Sri Lanka could not repay the interest on its debt, China agreed to \\n\\ntake equity in the port. China is also proactive, offering to pursue projects without solicitation. Its \\n\\nloans to Sri Lanka now exceed $8 billion, a sum that grew as leaders found each project too \\n\\ntempting to turn down.9  \\n\\nInfrastructure projects have short and long-term implications for Chinese exports. In the short \\n\\nterm, these projects are aiding Chinese exports of construction-related goods. Chinese exports to \\n\\nPakistan, for example, increased 77 percent between 2012 and 2015.10 Chinese producers of \\n\\nsteel, concrete, and other construction materials stand to benefit from projects that use them, as \\n\\ndo Chinese engineering and construction firms. These activities provide important but modest \\n\\nrelief for Chinese overcapacity, a problem that will still need to be addressed even if the BRI’s \\n\\nambitious spending targets are reached. Despite the BRI’s scale, it is too small to solve China’s \\n\\novercapacity challenges.11    \\n\\nOver the longer term, new infrastructure could facilitate trade by improving connectivity \\n\\nbetween China and its trading partners. The actual impacts will depend on both macro and micro \\n\\nfactors, such as the trajectories of the recipient economies and whether the right projects were \\n\\nselected. There is no question the region needs infrastructure investment. Developing Asia alone \\n\\nrequires $26 trillion in infrastructure investment between 2017 and 2030 to maintain current \\n\\ngrowth rates and adapt to climate change, according to ADB estimates.12 If all that infrastructure \\n\\nappeared tomorrow, flawlessly built where markets required it, there would be large trade gains. \\n\\nBut many barriers to trade would still remain, from onerous customs paperwork to divergent \\n\\nstandards. Upgrading Asia’s “soft” infrastructure will be important as well.  \\n\\nTrade agreements could provide that upgrade, and they have been placed under the BRI banner \\n\\nas well. Chinese officials have described a network of free trade agreements that would support \\n\\nthe BRI, but to date, China appears primarily focused on bilateral trade deals.13 Given the diverse \\n\\nlist of countries participating in the BRI, a BRI-wide trade agreement is highly unlikely. While \\n\\nlowering barriers between China and individual markets, additional bilateral deals could further \\n\\n8 AidData. 2017.

China’s approach is centralized yet \\n\\nflexible. It is centralized in bringing together many of the above elements in a single deal. When \\n\\na recipient country considers an offer from China, it often interacts with all the key actors, who \\n\\noften present a unified front. This differs from the “Western approach,” which involves dealing \\n\\nseparately with a wider range of actors, including some who coordinate loosely, others that \\n\\noperate independently, and others that actively compete with each other.15   \\n\\nChina’s approach is flexible in at least three respects. First, China is willing to work with any \\n\\ngovernment. While this approach predates the BRI, it can be seen in the list of BRI participants, \\n\\nwhich even includes participants with active conflicts, such as Syria and Yemen.16 Second, \\n\\nChina is often willing to build to budget and with less stringent requirements for meeting social \\n\\nand environmental safeguards. Third, China is flexible in negotiating payment terms. It is willing \\n\\nto accept natural resources, for example, and when loans cannot be repaid it is sometimes willing \\n\\nto take equity. Centralization and flexibility provide more ways to get to “yes,” and they help get \\n\\nthere faster.   \\n\\nAll these tools magnify short-term incentives for starting projects, but they can also mask long-\\n\\nterm risks. \\n\\nAccess and Influence: Economic and Political Impacts \\n\\nThe economic and political impacts of the BRI are difficult to isolate and could even have \\n\\nopposing short and long-term implications. As noted earlier, the BRI is more a brand than a \\n\\nmaster plan with specific criteria for project inclusion. Temporally, functionally, and \\n\\ngeographically, what counts as a BRI project is open to interpretation. Even obvious cases can \\n\\nhave complicating factors. For example, there is a lag between the announcement of \\n\\ninfrastructure projects, construction, completion, and usage. The economic impact of a recently-\\n\\ncompleted railway project, for example, will not become clear for several years. This is a \\n\\nfrustrating answer, particularly for a hearing with a title that reminds us that the BRI’s fifth \\n\\nanniversary is later this year. Consistent, long-term monitoring of BRI-related activities will be \\n\\nimportant for finding more exact answers.   \\n\\nChinese government statements about the BRI’s economic impacts help illustrate these \\n\\nchallenges. Chinese officials and state media often frame the BRI’s impacts in broad terms. It is \\n\\ncommon to hear about trade, investment, tourism, and other flows between China and “BRI \\n\\n14 “China signs over 130 transport pacts with Belt and Road countries,” CGTN, April 21, 2017. \\nhttp://www.scio.gov.cn/31773/35507/35520/Document/1549108/1549108.htm  \\n\\n15 For more research on differences between Western and Chinese approaches to infrastructure, see: CSIS and \\nStanford Global Projects Center, “Constructing a New Global Order,” December 18, 2017.  \\n\\nhttps://www.csis.org/events/western-and-chinese-infrastructure-development-abroad  \\n\\n16 Jonathan Hillman, “Will China’s Belt and Road stretch further?” Nikkei Asian Review, December 26, 2017. \\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Viewpoints/Jonathan-Hillman/Will-China-s-Belt-and-Road-stretch-further    \\n\\n31Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n7 \\n\\npartners” or “BRI countries.”17 Some studies have claimed the BRI is greatly enhancing these \\n\\nconnections. But they use questionable timelines, often relying on data that predates the BRI, and \\n\\ndo not separate recent developments from economic trends that were underway before the BRI. \\n\\nOther popular metrics are often incomplete. For example, Chinese state media trumpet the \\n\\nincrease in freight train services between China and Europe. But they do not state the value of \\n\\ncargo carried, and they rarely refer to trains traveling in the opposite direction, which occur less \\n\\nfrequently and carry more empty containers.  \\n\\nWith these challenges in mind, there are some nascent trends that merit further observation. First, \\n\\nChinese outbound capital restrictions appear to be more relaxed for BRI-related transactions. \\n\\nDeals that might be classified as advancing the BRI are more likely to be approved, and to be \\n\\napproved faster.18 In contrast, China has been reining in outbound deals for foreign real estate, \\n\\nentertainment, and sports teams.19 Third, the BRI’s emphasis on infrastructure has helped boost \\n\\nChinese exports of construction-related goods and services. The longer-term trajectories of these \\n\\ntrends, whether outbound capital is invested effectively and transportation corridors mature into \\n\\neconomic corridors, hinge on implementation.  \\n\\nPolitically, China is already benefitting from the BRI with individual countries and globally. \\n\\nTraditional partners like Pakistan, where BRI-related investments total roughly $62 billion, have \\n\\nbecome even closer. Chinese infrastructure loans have helped persuade some countries, \\n\\nincluding the Philippines and Cambodia, to reevaluate military or diplomatic ties with the United \\n\\nStates. China is also forging ties with countries further west, particularly those in Central and \\n\\nEastern Europe. China’s “16+1” framework brings together a diverse set of countries in the \\n\\nregion, many of whom have little in common other than their interest in doing business with \\n\\nChina. These and other developments suggest the BRI is producing political dividends. \\n\\nGlobally, the BRI positions China as the leader of a new form of globalization. Much of this \\n\\nrhetoric sounds familiar, but carries a different meaning. For example, in his opening remarks at \\n\\nthe BRI Forum in May 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke about upholding the \\n\\nmultilateral trading system, liberalizing investment, and promoting transparent rules. “We should \\n\\nbuild an open platform of cooperation,” he urged, “and uphold and grow an open world \\n\\neconomy.” But the BRI’s openness is questionable, as evident in the contractor trends noted \\n\\nearlier. Yet other countries are beginning to echo this rhetoric. Several have announced their \\n\\nintentions to “link” their national development plans and broader economic initiatives with the \\n\\nBRI.  \\n\\nEconomically and politically, the BRI also faces near-term constraints and longer-term \\n\\nchallenges. When smaller economies do business with China, they are often balancing rather \\n\\n17 In addition to their analytical shortcomings, these framings should also be avoided because they carry negative \\npolitical connotations. Terms like “BRI country” subtly subvert each country’s independence to China.  \\n\\n18 Drazen Jorgic, “In Pakistan, China presses built-in advantage for ‘Silk Road’ contracts,” Reuters, June 13, 2017. \\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-silkroad-pakistan-insight/in-pakistan-china-presses-built-in-advantage-for-\\n\\nsilk-road-contracts-idUSKBN19503Y  \\n\\n19 Dominique Fong and Esther Fung, “Chinese Property Shopping Spree Fades as Beijing Hits the Brakes,” Wall \\nStreet Journal, October 31, 2017. https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-property-shopping-spree-fades-as-beijing-\\n\\nhits-the-brakes-1509454804?mg=prod/accounts-wsj  \\n\\n32Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n8 \\n\\nthan directly aligning themselves. Dependencies can develop over time, of course, as Sri Lanka’s \\n\\nexperience illustrates. But smaller countries also seek to diversify their economic relationships. \\n\\nIn 2016, for example, every leader that took office in Southeast Asia discussed infrastructure \\n\\nprojects with both China and Japan. “This is a good competition,” Indonesia’s Finance Minister \\n\\nSri Mulyani Indrawati said last year.20 A key question for the longer term is whether this \\n\\ncompetition fosters a race to the top in standards and quality, or a race to the bottom.  \\n\\nNot all the BRI’s political impacts have been positive. For some countries that have signed on, \\n\\nthere is a gap emerging between expectations and actual benefits. South Korea has embraced the \\n\\ninitiative, for example, but it has yet to cooperate with China on concrete projects. Economic \\n\\ncooperation has been held up by differences over North Korea, highlighting how the BRI can \\n\\nquickly take a backseat to other interests.21 The BRI has been met with various degrees of \\n\\nskepticism and concern elsewhere, such as Western Europe, Japan, and India. The BRI’s roster \\n\\nmay seem long at roughly 70 participants, but that still leaves about 125 countries that have not \\n\\njoined. Ultimately, the BRI’s longer-term political impacts hinge on its execution and its \\n\\neconomic performance.  \\n\\nOver time, support for the BRI could decline and even turn against China. Large infrastructure \\n\\nprojects are rarely delivered on time, on budget, with their promised benefits—even in the best \\n\\nbusinesses environments.22 Most BRI-related projects will encounter difficulties in the coming \\n\\nyears. Projects that rely too heavily on Chinese labor, rather than local labor, can stoke \\n\\nresentment. Some projects will fail outright. Others will creep along and succeed only partially – \\n\\ndelivering some commercial benefits, for example, while also introducing environmental costs. \\n\\nWhen projects disappoint for any reason, China stands to suffer reputational damage. What looks \\n\\nlike boldness today might look like hubris in two decades.   \\n\\nThe BRI is also constrained by China’s domestic political imperatives. The BRI aims to increase \\n\\nthe flow of goods and people, but China’s overbearing security presence near border areas is \\n\\nsuffocating commercial activity. Chinese capital controls, while favoring outbound investment \\n\\nfor BRI-related projects, are still inefficient and overly restrictive for inbound investments. The \\n\\nBRI aspires to promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge, but Chinese censorship is \\n\\nincreasing. These trends all contradict the BRI’s expressed goal of improving global \\n\\nconnectivity. Beijing’s dilemma is that greater connectivity requires giving up some control.  \\n\\nWinning Business and Shaping Systems: U.S. Economic Interests \\n\\nWhether the BRI succeeds or fails, its vast scale and scope guarantees consequences for U.S. \\n\\ninterests. The United States has a range of economic interests at stake, from immediate \\n\\ncommercial opportunities to ensuring the viability and stability of major global systems in the \\n\\n20 Shotaro Tani, “Indonesia minister: Japan, China rivalry good for Asian infrastructure,” Nikkei Asian Review, May \\n5, 2017. https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/Indonesia-minister-Japan-China-rivalry-\\n\\ngood-for-Asian-infrastructure  \\n\\n21 Jonathan Hillman, “South Korea bids to close rift with China,” Nikkei Asian Review, December 13, 2017. https://\\n\\nasia.nikkei.com/Viewpoints/Jonathan-Hillman/South-Korea-bids-to-close-rift-with-China  \\n\\n22 Bent Flyvbjerg, 2017, ed., The Oxford Handbook of Megaproject Management, Oxford University Press, Chapter \\n1, pp. 1-18. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2742088  \\n\\n33Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n9 \\n\\nlonger term. Commercial opportunities should exist for U.S. suppliers, service providers, and \\n\\ninvestors to participate in BRI-related projects. To date, U.S. suppliers that have participated \\n\\nhave often done so through joint-ventures with Chinese firms. There are also opportunities for \\n\\nU.S. logistics firms and other potential users of completed projects. Hewlett-Packard, for \\n\\nexample, was an early pioneer of the direct China-Europe freight trains that are now expanding. \\n\\nTo date, however, U.S. and Western firm participation in BRI-related projects has been relatively \\n\\nmodest.  \\n\\nAt least three barriers stand between U.S. companies and BRI-related projects. First, companies \\n\\nneed access to timely and accurate information about BRI-related opportunities. Many U.S. \\n\\ncompanies are now aware of the BRI’s potential scale and wide range of activities, but they are \\n\\nstruggling to identify concrete business opportunities. As noted earlier, one of the nascent trends \\n\\nin the CSIS Reconnecting Asia database is that public information about some Chinese-funded \\n\\nprojects is more difficult to obtain in the project’s earliest stages, which is typically when bids \\n\\nare solicited. Greater transparency would help. \\n\\nSecond, after learning about specific opportunities, U.S. companies sometimes confront an \\n\\nuneven playing field. Many of the tools for advancing the BRI noted earlier give Chinese firms \\n\\nan edge in winning contracts. National champions benefit from state subsidies. Financing can be \\n\\ntied to picking Chinese firms. As noted earlier, the low participation of U.S. contractors in \\n\\nChinese-funded transportation projects is not a challenge unique to U.S. firms but affects non-\\n\\nChinese firms more generally. Different methods for estimating project costs and revenues can \\n\\nalso favor Chinese firms. These considerations extend beyond U.S. competitiveness and also \\n\\nimpact recipient countries, which risk entering commitments without fully accounting for \\n\\noperations, maintenance, and other lifecycle costs.  \\n\\nThird, even if competition is open and fair, a host of risks can outweigh the potential rewards for \\n\\nU.S. firms. Partnering with foreign firms can present IP-theft risks. Elections, corruption, \\n\\ncomplicated land rights, and other political and legal risks can threaten a project’s viability. \\n\\nFunding risks arise from the capital-intensive nature of infrastructure projects, long repayment \\n\\nschedules, and the challenges that developing economies might encounter along the way.23 When \\n\\nprojects are completed, weak demand and other operational challenges remain. These risks are a \\n\\nprimary reason why U.S. institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, \\n\\nrarely venture into emerging market infrastructure.    \\n\\nEven more important to U.S. economic interests is the BRI’s longer-term impact on major global \\n\\nsystems. Since World War II, the United States has played a leading role in creating, expanding, \\n\\nand defending open trade and financial systems. The United States has done this not merely out \\n\\nof goodwill, but also out of self-interest. U.S. economic strength flows from the dynamism of its \\n\\nprivate sector and the U.S. economy’s central position within these systems. Of course, \\n\\nglobalization has also produced costs at home, a critical challenge that must be addressed but is \\n\\noutside the scope of this hearing. But as foreign markets have grown over the past seven-plus \\n\\ndecades, so has the United States.   \\n\\n23 David Wijeratne, et al. “Repaving the ancient Silk Roads,” PricewaterhouseCoopers, May 2017. \\n\\nhttps://www.pwc.com/gx/en/growth-markets-centre/assets/pdf/pwc-gmc-repaving-the-ancient-silk-routes-web.pdf \\n\\n34Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n10 \\n\\nA BRI that succeeds on China’s terms could revise these systems to reflect Chinese interests. \\n\\nChanges would be seen in supply chains for goods, from manufactured products to energy and \\n\\nother resources. China’s currency would become more widely used. Chinese technical standards, \\n\\nfor everything from high-speed railway systems to wireless networks, would become more \\n\\nwidely adopted, as would Chinese preferences for environmental and social safeguards. \\n\\nCollectively, these changes would push the United States away from its current position in the \\n\\nglobal economy and move China toward the center.   \\n\\nA BRI that fails also has implications for U.S. economic interests. The financial burden that \\n\\ndeveloping economies are assuming through Chinese loans is considerable. Many recipients are \\n\\ncounting on sustaining high GDP growth to pay back their loans, setting ambitious targets that \\n\\nleave little room for error or unexpected events. Many of today’s assumptions about China are \\n\\nalso based on its spectacular rates of growth over recent decades. Events within or outside China \\n\\ncould lead to enough of these loans failing as to impact the broader global economy. Rather than \\n\\nhelping write the next chapter in regional integration, a failing BRI could set the region back, \\n\\nharming global growth. \\n\\nThese economic developments carry strategic implications as well. A separate panel will address \\n\\nstrategic concerns in greater detail, but two areas are intimately tied with the BRI’s infrastructure \\n\\nfocus and should be briefly noted. First, transportation infrastructure is dual-use, meaning that it \\n\\ncan be used to move goods to market as well as militaries to battle. Second and more broadly, the \\n\\nUnited States has the same fundamental interest it has had since World War II in ensuring that no \\n\\nsingle power dominates the Eurasian supercontinent. If a hegemon does emerge, history suggests \\n\\nthat new infrastructure will be an important indicator and vehicle for influence. \\n\\nRecommendations \\n\\nThe United States must not only be vigilant, it must advance a vision of its own for the region. It \\n\\nis sobering to recall the U.S. position in Asia at the beginning of this century. In 2000, a \\n\\nbipartisan commission at the Harvard Kennedy School examined U.S. national interests and \\n\\nnoted, “No country in East Asia, including China, appears capable of seriously challenging US \\n\\nleadership any time soon unless America, through neglect or indifference, were to create a \\n\\nvacuum.”24 Today, the U.S. position in Asia is considerably weaker. Neglect can be seen in the \\n\\nU.S. decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Indifference can be seen in the \\n\\nabsence of a positive U.S. economic vision for the region. \\n\\nThe Administration’s support for a “free and open Indo-Pacific” is a welcome development. \\n\\nFeatured prominently in both the U.S. National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, \\n\\nthis framing has several strengths. It focuses on what is likely to be the main arena for great \\n\\npower competition, economically and strategically, in the twenty-first century. It emphasizes the \\n\\nmaritime domain, which despite the BRI’s ambitions to create new economic corridors across the \\n\\n24 Graham Allison, et al. “America’s National Interests: A Report from The Commission on America\\'s National \\nInterests,” Harvard Kennedy School, July 2000. https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/americas-national-\\n\\ninterests-report-commission-americas-national-interests-2000  \\n\\n35Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n11 \\n\\nEurasian landmass, will remain the primary conduit for global trade. It positions the U.S. to work \\n\\nclosely with allies and partners in the region, many of whom have expressed similar aspirations.  \\n\\nBut more must be done to operationalize these ideas. Resources matter more than rhetoric. For \\n\\nexample, it is necessary but not sufficient to warn recipient countries against risky lending and \\n\\nquestionable projects. Put yourself in the shoes of a foreign leader seeking international support \\n\\nfor infrastructure projects. On the one hand, you have offers for specific projects that could start \\n\\nimmediately. On the other hand, you have warnings about medium and long-term risks. \\n\\nPolitically and psychologically, the scales are tilted toward taking the risky offer today. Even the \\n\\nstrongest language is not likely to persuade recipient countries to turn down risky infrastructure \\n\\noffers, particularly those with acute development needs. What’s needed are better alternatives.  \\n\\nWorking with the Administration, Congress has an important role to play in operationalizing the \\n\\n“Indo-Pacific” concept and expanding the availability of better financing alternatives. First, \\n\\nCongress should direct the Administration to establish standards and principles for infrastructure \\n\\ninvestment in the region. There is growing recognition about the importance of “quality \\n\\ninfrastructure,” but there are competing definitions for what quality means. The challenge is not \\n\\nonly building consensus about preferred outcomes, but also the processes that lead to better \\n\\noutcomes. These standards would cover procurement, environmental and social safeguards, and \\n\\ndebt sustainability, among other issues. \\n\\nSecond, to build international support for these principles, Congress should preserve U.S. \\n\\ninfluence in the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral development \\n\\nbanks. China alone cannot meet Asia’s infrastructure needs, and these institutions will remain \\n\\ncentral in setting standards and providing alternatives. The Administration can also build support \\n\\nby working with partners and allies and through the G-20 and other multilateral bodies. Done \\n\\ncorrectly, these principles will take hold not only in Asia, but in other regions where competing \\n\\napproaches exist, such as Eastern and Central Europe.  \\n\\nThird, to help U.S. companies compete overseas, Congress should strengthen the U.S. foreign \\n\\neconomic policy toolkit. Concerns about the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private \\n\\nInvestment Corporation crowding out private sector investment, while grounded in economic \\n\\ntheory, are at odds with economic reality. Foreign governments have already tilted the playing \\n\\nfield. There is merit in considering whether some U.S. commercial agencies could be \\n\\nconsolidated and streamlined for greater efficiency and unity of action, but the bottom line is that \\n\\ntheir activities should be fully resourced, as should the U.S. Department of State. \\n\\nTo be sure, the United States should not aspire to replicate the BRI’s scale with federal spending. \\n\\nBut through resourcing the efforts mentioned above, the U.S. and its partners and allies can \\n\\nexpand private sector investment. Globally, institutional investors—such as pension funds, \\n\\nmutual funds, insurance companies, and others such as sovereign wealth funds—manage more \\n\\nthan $100 trillion.25 Only a small fraction of that largess is invested in infrastructure. The actions \\n\\n25 Rabah Arezki, et al. “From Global Savings Glut to Financing Infrastructure: The Advent of Investment \\nPlatforms,” International Monetary Fund, February 2016. \\n\\nhttps://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp1618.pdf  \\n\\n36Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n12 \\n\\nrecommended above would help manage risks, expand the pool of bankable projects, and \\n\\nmobilize more private capital. \\n\\nThe BRI has all the marks of a difficult foreign policy challenge. It is a slow-moving \\n\\ndevelopment that will unfold in decades rather than days. It is functionally and geographically \\n\\nvast, spanning the responsibilities of many U.S. agencies. It requires grappling with both \\n\\neconomics and security issues. It will be tempting to delay action and difficult to coordinate an \\n\\neffective response. Ultimately, the best U.S. response to the BRI is not a response at all, but a \\n\\ncompelling U.S. economic vision, resourced strategically and sustained over time. \\n\\n37Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF RANDAL PHILLIPS \\nMANAGING PARTNER, MINTZ GROUP \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you, Mr. Hillman. \\nAnd now Mr. Phillips, please. \\nMR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you very much and thank you to the Commission for this \\n\\nopportunity to address this issue. \\nSimilar to my fellow panelists on this, this issue is something that needs to be \\n\\ntaken very seriously.  As was mentioned, when this came out in November of 2013, it caught \\nmany people by surprise, mostly the Chinese bureaucracy and the SOE realm because this had \\nbeen coming out of an internal Communist Party think tank, this idea, and it was latched on to by \\nXi Jinping as similar to some of his other initiatives that we have seen before and since of \\nrejuvenating China and bigger, more ambitious programs. \\n\\nIt certainly has become something that is--that the bureaucracy has very much \\nrallied around. China, which is the country that invented bureaucracy, knows how to get a \\nprogram passed, and so now every agency of government, as well as state-owned enterprise, in \\nChina has their own internal Belt and Road commission internally to figure out how they can get \\na project passed, subsidies gained, and call it Belt and Road.  So it\\'s a very amorphous piece. \\n\\nIf you look at the mission statement--it\\'s beautiful--that China has for Belt and \\nRoad Initiative, it talks a lot about win-win cooperation, which we see in a lot of other elements \\nof China\\'s foreign policy.  This is something that on the ground in Beijing we like to say that \\nmeans China wins twice, but it\\'s--we semi-morbidly joke with our Chinese counterparts on that.  \\nBut sometimes it feels that way.  But it\\'s a beautiful mission statement. \\n\\nBut really if you look at what drove this program for Xi Jinping to put forward, I \\nwould say there\\'s five or six key things that need to be addressed. \\n\\nFirst, the timing of it.  It was certainly coming on the heels of the U.S. pivot to \\nAsia, and there was genuine concern on the ground in Beijing at that time of what was this going \\nto mean.  At that time, we were talking about TPP and TTIP as trade initiatives to be sort of the \\neconomic ballast of the military pivot to Asia, and so the ground was fertile for a Chinese \\ninitiative in this regard to try to compete in a sense on that.  And certainly there is the need for \\nthe infrastructure spend, as has been noted, but it also--this was going to be somewhat of an \\nanswer to that. \\n\\nI\\'d also say that China likes, particularly Xi Jinping, his style of leadership--the \\nU.S. has always been given, and appropriately so, a lot of credit for the Marshall Plan after \\nWorld War II.  That is something that has come up a number of times in discussion with Chinese \\nofficials, and so this was an idea to be even bigger than the Marshall Plan, in a sense to make that \\nkind of impact.  And that appeals to Xi Jinping\\'s style of leadership.   \\n\\nOf course, it was mentioned, another factor here is China\\'s overcapacity issue, \\nparticularly in infrastructure-related materials and industries.  This is certainly a way.  I think \\neconomists can argue over exactly how much they can export of that overcapacity.  That\\'s \\ncertainly one area that is appealing to China. \\n\\nA third, I mentioned this with the Xi Jinping\\'s style of leadership.  This has taken \\nthe entire Chinese bureaucracy to a whole new level.  Under Deng Xiaoping, they were very \\nmuch following his policy guidance of \"hide your capabilities and bide your time.\" \\n\\nXi Jinping has completely discarded that, and you saw that now memorialized in \\nthe 19th Party Congress Constitution that was just passed.  This is a key part of this, along with \\n\\n3838\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nMade in China 2025 and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation are key aspects of him having \\nChina stand up and, as he said in the Party Congress this year, \"standing tall in the East.\"  This is \\na key part of that. \\n One other thing, and I find this a little bit morbidly of interest because of my \\nprevious government days, every time I do a briefing on Belt and Road Initiative, at least the \\nmaritime aspect of this, I\\'m reminded of about 13 years ago in my old job at Langley of finding a \\ndocument of the PLA\\'s desire to build a string of pearls of bases out to various places.  The \\nMaritime Silk Road looks remarkably similar to that.  So I find that to be of interest. \\n The fifth thing I would point out, the Belt and Road Initiative certainly fulfills a \\ndomestic need for China, particularly out in the western regions of China, in Xinjiang, Qinghai, \\nand Tibet as well, to be able to try to build out some of the infrastructure there as key instruments \\nheading out to Central Asia.  They find that domestically quite appealing. \\n And then I think you can\\'t look at this thing in separation from--I believe it\\'s been \\nnoted earlier--of China\\'s other key industrial policies, particularly Made in China 2025.  These \\nhave to be seen together--Belt and Road Initiative and that--because it\\'s a part of how China is, in \\ntheir own terminology, seeking the commanding heights of key industries and certainly the soft \\npower projection to be able to build on their objectives of again having China be predominant, \\ncertainly in the region and a region that they consider critical to themselves. \\n I would just add one or two other things. I think that you have to look at, you \\nknow, how is this thing going to work or will it work?  As Jonathan pointed out a minute ago, I \\nthink there\\'s some real risks in here.  Certainly you\\'re seeing a bit of that already in Sri Lanka \\nand Myanmar of some pushback when sovereignty or perceived national slights are at play, and \\nthere\\'s a lot of risk in this to be able to perhaps tip over on some of these sensitivities if China \\ndoesn\\'t play its hand right. \\n On the other hand, I\\'m reminded of Ross Perot\\'s comment in 1992 about the \\n\"giant sucking sound\" of the dollar heading down to Mexico if NAFTA is passed.  There is the \\ngiant sucking sound of the renminbi heading out to many places. \\n And while the United States and a number of other developed countries are \\nparticularly worried, and rightfully so, about the transparency of this program, of will there be \\nshared benefits, will it live up to the hype, will there be shared access, when you\\'re--if you look \\nat the number of the recipient countries on the developing countryside, they\\'re happy to see the \\ncash come in. \\n And unless there is, as Commissioner Shea mentioned, unless there is some \\ncompetition from somewhere else, it\\'s an open door.  So at this point, they\\'re happy to receive it.  \\nAnd if you look at--the final point I\\'d make on this--if you look at the Belt and Road Initiative \\nForum that--we called it BARF--in Beijing, again a little morbid humor--last May, to be able to \\nget 29 foreign leaders on relatively short notice for an international forum along with several \\ndozen ministerial level delegations to come to Beijing, that shows the power of that giant sucking \\nsound of the renminbi. \\n I\\'ll leave it there.  Thank you. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3939\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF RANDAL PHILLIPS \\nMANAGING PARTNER, MINTZ GROUP \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4040\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative \\nPanel I:  Mercantilism with Chinese Characteristics:  Creating Markets and \\n\\nCultivating Influence \\n\\nTestimony before the U.S. – China Economic and Security Review Commission \\n\\nRandal Phillips, Managing Partner for Asia, Mintz Group \\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\nIn the fall of 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the strategic conception \\nof building the “Silk Road Economic Belt” and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road,” \\nknown shortly as the “One Belt and One Road” (OBOR) initiatives.  Interestingly, this \\ninitiative when announced was very much a top down exercise, an idea that caught \\nXi’s eye from within policy research elements of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) \\nand put forth with relatively little input from below.  Much of the Chinese government \\nbureaucracy that would have to support it found themselves having to scramble to \\nfigure out exactly what Xi meant by this, and what the scale and scope of effort needed \\nwould be to support it.  Given the direct linkage to Xi as a signature policy, the Chinese \\nbureaucracy proceeded to rally quickly to flesh this out and it has subsequently \\nbecome a cause too big to fail in the Chinese system. \\n\\nChina’s official mission statement for OBOR is:  “The idea carries forward the spirit of \\nthe ancient Silk Road that was based on mutual trust, equality and mutual benefits, \\ninclusiveness and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation.  It also conforms to the \\n21st century norms of promoting peace, development, cooperation and adopting a \\nwin-win strategy for all.  The conception organically links the “Chinese dream” to the \\n“Global dream” and has far-reaching strategic significance with a global impact.” \\n\\nAs mission statements go, that does a great job of capturing all the catch phrases of \\nrecent propaganda efforts by the CCP under Xi’s leadership, but doesn’t capture fully \\nthe motivations behind this effort.  There are several drivers of this policy that must \\nbe fully appreciated to understand why this is of such import to the Chinese \\nleadership.  These include: \\n\\n1. At the time of the announcement of the OBOR policy, China was wrestling\\nwith its desired response to the U.S. “rebalance to Asia,” and in particular\\nits economic component the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).  Taken\\ntogether with the effort by the Obama administration to pursue a similar\\nfree trade initiative with Europe (TTIP), China saw the need to present\\nalternative rules and regimes for the future.  The relatively vacant space of\\ninfrastructure spending provided a ready-made and relatively benign path\\nto do so.\\n\\n2. The Chinese leadership under Xi Jinping has recognized the need to deal\\nwith “supply side” issues of overcapacity, as well as excess foreign\\n\\n41Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nexchange reserves, and an initiative such as this provides a channel to \\naddress these issues to China’s benefit. \\n\\n3. A central issue to Xi Jinping is the “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,”\\nwhich essentially means having China play a much more active and central\\nrole in world affairs than that which had been pursued previously under\\nDeng Xiaoping’s dictum to hide capabilities and bide time.  Xi sees OBOR as\\nan ideal political and economic platform on which to boost China’s\\ninternational position and image, something greater in scope and ambition\\nto the U.S. Marshall Plan after World War II and hard to oppose on the face\\nof the policy given the infrastructure demand in the regions involved.  The\\nlack of specific target dates for completion of any initiatives also allows the\\nChinese leadership to declare success as it sees fit and not be bound to any\\nhard deadlines.\\n\\n4. The maritime “road” portion of the plan firmly plays to China’s desire to\\nbuild the infrastructure and capacity to diversify its energy supplies and\\nreduce the risk of being “strangled” in the Straits of Malacca in a conflict\\nsituation.  This matches concerns reflected in internal People’s Liberation\\nArmy (PLA) planning documents dating back over a decade looking to\\npromote energy transmission routes through Burma, potentially building\\na canal through the Carat Isthmus in Thailand, and ports in Pakistan, Sri\\nLanka and beyond.\\n\\n5. It remains a high priority of the Chinese leadership to more fully develop\\nthe western regions of China, for economic as well as domestic stability\\nreasons.  This means that Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Yunnan are likely\\nto receive a disproportionate amount of funding and attention in the\\nlifespan of this initiative, something certainly welcome to those regions but \\nalso a driver for major foreign and domestic investment decisions.\\n\\n6. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the ramifications of OBOR must be\\nassessed together with China’s massive industrial policy initiative “Made\\nin China 2025.”  Launched in 2015, this policy seeks to make China the\\nworld leader in 10 critical categories of the economy that are on the cutting \\nedge of 21st century industries.  In that regard, China has launched the\\nequivalent of 10 Manhattan Project-style initiatives to “gain the\\ncommanding heights” in these sectors, driving large scale investment\\ndecisions and setting clear market access restrictions.  Just the scale of the\\neffort, let alone the degree to which China is successful, will heavily\\ninfluence world markets in key sectors and be a major player in China’s\\neconomic relations worldwide.\\n\\nAs has been seen in increasingly glowing government and CCP pronouncements since \\nNovember 2013, capped off by OBOR’s enshrinement in the CCP Constitution at the \\n19th Party Congress in October 2017, this initiative is a centerpiece for Xi’s economic \\nand foreign policies and thus will receive the benefit of the entirety of the PRC’s \\nbureaucratic and corporate backing.  It is too big to fail, and at least as long as Xi is \\naround, it won’t be allowed to fail.  The front lines of support are provided by China’s \\nrecently established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a thus far \\n\\n42Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nseemingly well functioning new multilateral institution that serves as a showpiece for \\nChina’s evolving pursuit of an alternative global construct.  While up and running in \\nrelatively short order, however, the AIIB’s importance in financing OBOR, at least thus \\nfar, is far outshone in terms of scope by China Development Bank (CDB) and China \\nExport-Import Bank (China Ex-Im).  It’s precisely the central role of these institutions \\nthat is troubling to U.S. and other foreign officials – and companies seeking to get \\ninvolved - given the very limited transparency in operations they provide, and the \\nclear role they play in advancing China’s economic interests.  CDB and China Ex-Im \\nare able to act above the fray in China’s bureaucracy, and continue to effectively rebuff \\nefforts by foreign governments and entities alike to gain insight into their compliance \\nand decision-making processes. \\n\\nOne must tip their hat to the country that invented bureaucracy, as China has fully \\nharnessed its government departments, domestic state-owned enterprises, and \\nmajor “private” multinationals to all recognize the benefit (and essentially the \\nnecessity) to create their own OBOR policies as a priority and pursue it accordingly. \\nEntities are falling all over themselves to declare their support for OBOR and create \\nunits within their respective organizations to drive projects labeled as dedicated to \\nOBOR’s success and show their fealty to this policy.  It’s not only politically correct, \\nbut good business. That mindset has transcended to most multinational corporations, \\nincluding many U.S. firms, who also go out of their way to inform their PRC \\ninterlocutors – especially SOE’s - that they, too, have created OBOR teams in their \\nentities to help guide their approach to the PRC market and beyond. \\n\\nAs a recent analytical assessment produced by the Conference Board stated, OBOR is \\nclearly an ambitious platform for China to try to soak up at least a good portion of its \\nacute industrial overcapacity and support growth for distressed state industry.  It is \\narguably China’s most audacious effort yet to try to engineer growth, and reaffirms \\nthe grip and control China’s government has over major assets in the economy, as \\nwell as the socioeconomic imperative to keep them producing.  It also illustrates the \\nleadership’s lack of progress, at least thus far, in migrating growth drivers away from \\nstate-financed investment toward household consumption.  Finally, OBOR represents \\nan intervention and deployment of central government funds that flies in the face of \\nthe celebrated November 2013 CCP Third Plenum promise to let markets play a \\ndecisive role in China’s economy going forward. \\n\\nThis past year has been pivotal in trying to assess what’s real and what’s hype with \\nOBOR.  Many corporate executives, trade diplomats and China watchers worldwide \\nwatched in awe – well-founded skepticism but yet awestruck – as Xi Jinping \\naddressed the World Economic Forum in January 2017 extolling the virtues of \\nglobalization, openness, connectivity and a free and fair trading order.  These were \\npeople well steeped in the effects of China’s highly protectionist policies at home, thus \\nfinding it amazing that they were listening to Xi’s anti-protectionist rhetoric abroad \\nand wondering if the world had been turned on its head given the positive reception \\nhe received.  This is magnified by the fact that the vast majority of US and European \\nobservers involved in the region believe that China under Xi has been closing, rather \\n\\n43Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nthan opening, doors to trade and investment, and accelerating on a path towards \\nisolation, insulation, illiberalism and more government controls. \\n\\nOn the other hand, one must also look at the success China achieved with the May \\n2017 Belt and Road Forum on International Cooperation in Beijing, seeming to \\nindicate that much of the global community may have a different, and more \\nwelcoming, perspective on China’s vision and role in the world.  The turnout speaks \\nfor itself – twenty-nine heads of state and several dozen other ministerial-level \\nnational delegations – all coming to Beijing on relatively short notice compared to the \\nnorms of international conference planning.  Though the officially stated results and \\njoint communiqué issued from the conference was not earth-shattering in \\nsignificance, it would be hard to point to another gathering drawing such firepower \\nin comparison to what Xi Jinping was able to draw to Beijing.   \\n\\nSomewhat akin to what U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot famously stated in \\n1992 about the “giant sucking sound” of investment flows to Mexico should NAFTA \\npass, the enticement of RMB flows to recipient countries in the OBOR path is at least \\nas real.  While advanced economies have tended to focus on China’s perceived desire \\nto alter global norms, its paranoia about information and data flows, its lack of \\nreciprocity in trade and investment policies, its internet firewall and increased \\nobsession with national security – all understandable and legitimate concerns – the \\nBelt and Road Forum attendees mostly from developing countries all demonstrated \\nthrough their attendance that they are not overly concerned about any of these issues. \\nThis is music to the ears of Xi and the Chinese leadership, particularly as codified in \\nthe recent CCP 19th Party Congress official documentation that China should seek to \\nbe seen as a credible leader for 21st century globalization.  In this view China is \\nessentially offering ups its blend of state capitalism, socialist market economy, \\nauthoritarian political control, and new multilateral institutions as a new path for \\ncountries to consider and the possible backbone of a new international order.  Given \\nthat most of the OBOR interested nations are highly protectionist with state-led \\neconomies in their own right, this is not a hard sell for China.   \\n\\nThe net effect of these views is that there is an effective dividing line between \\ndeveloped and developing nations in their outlook on OBOR. Essentially there is a \\nbattle between those concerned over changing China’s behavior on an ample number \\nof trade, investment and governance issues, and those relatively unfazed by this and \\ninstead focused on scrambling for the cash.  China is betting on the latter side winning, \\nand is being quite transparent in its position and confident in its ascendancy.  There \\nis every reason to believe based on the record of the past five years of Xi’s leadership, \\nthe priorities he ensured were endorsed at the 19th Party Congress, and the very \\npublic pronouncements being issued to “grasp the historic opportunity,” that China \\nunder Xi will not liberalize in the manner that most Western audiences had hoped or \\nexpected.  The good news, at least to those who are worrying about China’s perceived \\nambitions to change the global order, is that China’s actions thus far point to a more \\nregional rather than global scope.  This is certainly true in Eurasia and parts of Africa. \\nChina has laid down a marker that it is the leading driver of developmental policy in \\n\\n44Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nthese regions, and is increasingly expecting other nations and existing multilateral \\ninstitutions to acknowledge this. \\n\\nSo what should multinational companies expect from China’s OBOR \\ninitiative?   \\n\\nThe first thing that needs to be recognized is that OBOR does not provide a level \\nplaying field for Western MNC’s to compete with Chinese firms.  It is plain and simple \\nan instrument of China’s political and economic growth and manifestation of the \\nopportunity Xi Jinping sees for China to take center stage in the world.  That said, \\nthere are, and will be, quite a number of opportunities for foreign businesses to \\nparticipate in the “best supporting actor” category.  We are seeing this on the ground \\nin Beijing and Shanghai among numerous U.S. multinationals that are eager to carve \\nout opportunities.  The net effect thus far, and likely for the foreseeable future, is for \\ncompanies to play sub-contracting roles to leading Chinese enterprises, particularly \\nin the services sector such as commercial insurance, consulting, logistics, technical \\nservices provision, etc.  Many Chinese firms are bidding on OBOR-related contracts \\nfully knowledgeable that they do not possess the complete expertise in house to carry \\nout the project, but rather will have to subcontract many aspects to foreign firms, \\nknowing that OBOR is much like an affirmative action policy to benefit Chinese \\nenterprise in the leading roles.  While this limited role for foreign enterprises is on its \\nface distorted and a tilted playing field, a number of analysts assess that this may turn \\nout to be a good thing given the high risk, low economic return of the vast majority of \\nOBOR projects to date.  As has been seen in so many other areas of Chinese economic \\npolicy, the rate of return is much less important that the perceived or real political \\nand diplomatic benefits China is seeking.  This is why CDB and China Ex-Im, by far the \\ntwo leading financers of OBOR, are not particularly concerned in moving forward on \\ntheir projects while private sector entities are taking a comparatively more cautious \\napproach. \\n\\nSo will it work?  Like most things, it depends on how you define success.  As a political \\nand soft power initiative, it has already proven quite beneficial to China, and is likely \\nto continue on that path unless China unduly overplays its hand or stumbles into \\nscenarios where host sovereignty sensitivities are tweaked.  That’s a very real \\npotential outcome in such a grandiose project, but China at least to date has gone to \\ngreat lengths to try to ameliorate these risks.  The financing and economic return \\naspects of OBOR are likely to be the most challenging, and even with China’s very large \\nforeign exchange reserves and firm political commitment its hard to see China being \\nable to bear the brunt of this financing any more than a decade out, if even close to \\nthat amount of time.  The policy is directly tied to Xi Jinping personally, and since he’s \\nnow enshrined to be China’s paramount leader barring upheaval until he goes off to \\nmeet Marx, there is every reason to believe that the PRC will do everything possible \\nto sustain this policy.  \\n\\n45Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPANEL I QUESTION AND ANSWER \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you very much. \\nAnd now I know we each have a number of questions, and Commissioner Shea, \\n\\nwhy don\\'t you start off? \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Well, thank you to all three of you.  Very, very \\n\\ninteresting testimony. \\nI want to just begin with Ms. Rolland.  I want to congratulate you on your book.  \\n\\nIt\\'s really brilliant and highly readable, which I particularly appreciate.  So it\\'s really good.  \\nBut you asked a question in the title of your book, and I want you to answer this \\n\\nat some point today.  You say it\\'s called \"China\\'s Eurasian Century,\" and then you put question \\nmark.  So I want you to answer that question mark at some point during your testimony. \\n\\nBut my question is about--I think Mr. Phillips and Mr. Hillman also alluded to \\nthis--that there\\'s sort of a lockstep mentality in China about Belt and Road.  My experience is if \\nyou want to get money in China, if you\\'re a think tank, you put the words \"Belt and Road\" on a \\nproject, and you get support. \\n\\nI\\'m wondering could you tell me what is the level of domestic criticism or \\ndomestic concern within China?  If everybody is speaking in one voice 100 percent, that\\'s not \\nnecessarily a good thing.  I mean sometimes a little criticism leads to improvement.  Maybe we \\nhave too much criticism here in Washington and not enough improvement. \\n\\nBut in a system where everybody is walking in lockstep, it could lead to \\ndisastrous results.  So I was wondering if anybody could sort of tell me are there voices within \\nthe Chinese system that express reservations about Belt and Road or at least aspects of it?  \\nAnyone?   \\n\\nMR. PHILLIPS:  I\\'d be glad to make a few comments on that. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Sure. \\nMR. PHILLIPS:  Not yet or not, none that we have seen as of yet.  And I would \\n\\nsay it\\'s early days as I think you mentioned earlier.  Certainly you look at the SOEs and actually \\nmany private sector companies in China, they\\'ve all put together for the reasons you pointed out \\ntheir own Belt and Road committees.  \\n\\nCertainly in the early days of the Belt and Road Initiative when everybody was \\ntrying to figure out what this all was, you saw, particularly in Southeast Asia, a lot of the projects \\nthat were already underway or already investments anticipated being repurposed and called Belt \\nand Road Initiative, and as particularly state-owned enterprises went back for more funding or \\nwent to the China Development Bank or to Ex-Im, China Ex-Im Bank, it would be very useful to \\ncall it Belt and Road to be able to apply for those funds. \\n\\nI think if you just look at the total amount of actual executed funding so far for \\nBelt and Road Initiative, it\\'s fairly, it\\'s less than what was originally thought was going to be at \\nthis point, but it\\'s still early days on it.  So I think at this point it\\'s still very useful to a lot of the \\ncompanies. \\n\\nInternally, in the Party, they haven\\'t really spent that much money on this yet.  \\nBut even with China\\'s significant foreign exchange reserves and capabilities, with the other \\nproblems they\\'re dealing with right now, if, depending on how the pace of these projects being \\nexecuted, those voices could raise in the coming few years if some other economic priorities start \\npressing. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Ms. Rolland. \\n\\n4646\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n MS. ROLLAND:  I think the voices of reservations are not publicly available, but \\nif you\\'re talking with people, they might--some of them might have some reservations and think \\nthat maybe it\\'s a bit too early for China to go out like this, and I think that some scholars have \\nsaid that there might be a risk of overstretch for China.  These are difficult countries that they\\'re \\ngoing to invest in, and so what kind of economic return are they going to get? \\n And all the problems that we can see here, they can see them too, you know, \\nproblems with conflicts and not great economic returns and so on and so forth.  So, but the center \\nhas given the directions, and now they have to fulfil the vision and try to find ways to make it \\nhappen knowing that it\\'s not going to be easy. \\n About \"China\\'s Eurasian Century?\" I think it depends on us whether it\\'s going to \\nbe a period or a question mark.  The title comes from, I think, as you could imagine, the balance \\nwith the Pacific century, and how maybe I think that China\\'s dream is to re-become the central \\npower over Asia and Eurasia.  This is what the China Dream is all about. \\n And so if it\\'s going to extend its influence over this continent, it might become \\nEurasian, its Eurasian century, and the Pacific century might become a thing of the past.  I don\\'t \\nread in crystal balls.  I\\'m just saying-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay.  All right. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  --this is what they\\'re trying to achieve. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  But your point is that it\\'s up to us as to-- \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Absolutely.  That\\'s my, that\\'s my thinking, yes. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay.  Thank you. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Let me jump in on that.  Through the course of \\npreparation for this hearing, I have been thinking continuously about risk management and when \\neverything is this gigantic, be it a Marshall Plan or a moon shot, from the way we Westerners \\nthink of it, there is risk management going on heavily. \\n In China, I know their mindset is different, but--and you all keep saying we\\'re at \\nthe early stage; we\\'re at the early stage.  How are they going to from the Chinese mentality \\napproach this huge vision of theirs?  And I want to get concrete on risk management.  How is it \\nbeing done in the local company level? \\n And maybe, Randy, you could, since you\\'ve been on the ground there out in \\ndifferent provinces a lot, you could start off with that, but I\\'d like to hear from each of you. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you.  Chairman Tobin, thank you very much.    \\n And I mentioned, as Chairman Shea noted earlier, with the example of Pakistan \\nand the dangers there for Chinese workers or others, that situation is playing out in Africa and \\nother locations where the Belt and Road Initiative projects are already underway. \\n And I can tell you from a concrete sense what I\\'ve seen on the ground now for a \\ncouple of years.  Previously there wasn\\'t much of an industry in China of think of it like \\nBlackwater-type \\ncompany to be able to provide security for Chinese companies abroad.  \\n Now there\\'s a vibrant industry there, and there\\'s been a lot of interest and \\ninteraction from Chinese officials, as well as state-owned enterprises and the private sector, in \\nthe last couple years reaching out to U.S. and others around the world to try to develop that \\nexpertise, realizing that as they project their investments out into more hostile environments, \\nthey\\'re going to have to protect their workers. \\n And then it also plays out on the PLA side of capabilities to perhaps have to \\nevacuate and deal with those type of contingencies.  So there is avid debate as well as active \\n\\n4747\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthings going on on the ground in China to try to develop these capabilities to be able to help their \\nindustries. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n Mr. Hillman. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  So with some of the infrastructure projects we track, I think one \\nof the big contrasts between the Western approach is that a lot of the risk management is done up \\nfront before a project is started, and so that\\'s often why it can be slower to start.  There are \\nstudies that are done.  You know, the China model is often faster and let\\'s deal with the risks as \\nthey come up as we encounter them in the projects. \\n But I also think that, you know, more broadly a lot of our thinking sometimes \\nabout how China is executing these projects is probably three or so years out of date because I do \\nthink that there\\'s learning that occurs.  You know they\\'re not immune to criticism.  Criticism \\nthat\\'s happened in Africa, I think, has impacted how they operate in Central Asia. \\n I think that there\\'s a willingness to try to hire more local labor because of the \\npolitical risk if you don\\'t do that.  I do think that there have been instances of holding up funding \\nbecause of corruption, including in Pakistan, you know, withholding funds. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Are you seeing them do those corrections? \\n MR. HILLMAN:  So, yes, but I think it\\'s also these risks differ so dramatically in \\nall of the places that we\\'re talking about.  So, yes, you know, generally, they\\'re challenging \\nbusiness environments.  But the risks that you face--the security risks you face in western \\nPakistan is not the same that you face in Eastern Europe, and Belt and Road is so sprawling that I \\nthink it\\'s very difficult to talk about these risks at that high level.  I think it\\'s a really sort of \\ncountry-by-country framing. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Ms. Rolland. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Yes, thank you.   \\n I would totally agree with everything that\\'s been just said.  I think for the security \\nof the Chinese assets and citizens, China is constrained by its noninterference policy right now.  \\nSo I think they\\'re starting to think about how to get around this, and there are several ways that I \\ncan already see coming. \\n The first is the delocalization of the security.  So you put the burden of the \\nsecurity of your assets and citizens on the local military and security forces like what we\\'ve seen \\nin Pakistan.  We\\'ve seen it also in Ethiopia, for example.   \\n There is also increasingly, and Randal is right to point out to this, that private \\nsecurity companies--Chinese--that are very active now and getting more important.   \\n There is an increasing security cooperation bilaterally, and also we\\'re starting to \\nsee emerging a sort of regional security cooperation with local countries and China so maybe an \\nemerging regional security framework really going on to tackle those risks as well. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n I know we have lots of questions.  Senator Talent. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  Thank you all.   \\n I\\'m going to make a statement and then follow with a question.  So when I look at \\nthis One Belt One Road, I\\'m just a poor old former public servant, you know.  I\\'m not an \\neconomist or anything else.  It looks to me like they\\'re spending an awful lot of their money--I\\'m \\ntalking about the land bridges now--to build infrastructure in other countries.  That\\'s what it \\nlooks like to me. \\n In other words, it\\'s almost like a colonial power building roads in its colonies \\n\\n4848\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nexcept they don\\'t have the colonies, and that didn\\'t even work for the colonial powers really. \\n So what are the terms?  I mean they\\'re not going to own these assets, right?  So \\nthat\\'s the first thing.  They\\'re not going to own them so they have to get, they have to have decent \\nterms on the loans, and the loans have to be paid, and you all have already commented on how \\nunstable the countries are.  So I\\'m looking at this and thinking, maybe more so than you guys are, \\nthat this is a loser for them on the land bridge stuff. \\n Now, Mr. Phillips, you said something about the maritime that I think is different \\nbecause there, it seems to me, they could end up getting a lot of really strategically important \\npoints under their control to protect their sea lanes. \\n So comment on both of that.  I mean is there a basis, do you think, as American \\npolicymakers consider this for distinguishing between the land bridges they\\'re building and the \\nMaritime Silk Road in terms of how we ought to deal with it and what the implications are for \\nus?  And how can they expect the economics of these land bridges to work?  And how are they \\ngoing to get enough return on the Mongolian-Russian land bridge? What kind of markets do they \\nthink they\\'re going to get out of that to justify an investment like that? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Senator. \\n I would certainly defer to my fellow panelists who have-- \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  Yeah.  I intended it for all three of you. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Excellent--the nuts and bolts of individual deals in a greater \\ndepth than I probably do, but I can tell you from all of the analysts I\\'ve spoken to on the ground \\nin China, I have yet to find one who thinks that this economically, that the returns on this are \\ngoing to be favorable. \\n But it\\'s not seen as an economic win, at least not yet.  It could potentially turn into \\nthat, but it\\'s much more of a soft power projection and a way to further build influence together \\nwith other major projects that China is doing with Made in China 2025 and the great \\nrejuvenation of the nation.  That\\'s all packaged together. \\n Economically, more people can paint a case, just as you did, that it could be a \\nloser or at best break even than anything else.  I would say that when you look at the Maritime \\nversus the Road, technically the Road is the Maritime, and why they did that, I\\'ll never know, but \\nI think a lot of people are looking geostrategically, and I would imagine some of the panels this \\nafternoon will talk about this. \\n At some point or another, it\\'s going to come up against Russia\\'s interests in \\nCentral Asia, and that\\'s a real friction point that I think everybody is waiting to see how that \\nplays out. \\n Certainly in the sea portion, I\\'ve spent a lot of time in ASEAN doing briefings \\nactually on this issue, starting a couple of years ago, and everybody there is very mindful, \\nparticularly the Singaporeans, of what this all means for China\\'s projection of force. \\n But at the same time they also see it as an economic opportunity so they\\'re trying \\nto hedge each way, which is something that, of course, we\\'re used to seeing.  But I think it most \\ndefinitely, as I mentioned earlier, with the PLA\\'s wishes for a number of years now in \\ndeveloping plans for how they would like to be able to control supply lines and become much \\nmore of a blue water force, this fits perfectly into it. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  So I think there is no question that the overland component of \\nBelt and Road is the most ambitious part of what is already a very ambitious vision.  And that\\'s \\nbecause for hundreds of years most commerce has traveled by the sea, right, and I don\\'t, I \\npersonally don\\'t think that this is going to really change that dramatically. \\n\\n4949\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n Something that we\\'re looking into is the emergence of these new China-to-Europe \\nrail services, which it seems like every month there\\'s a new, you know, from Chinese City A to \\nEuropean City B service that\\'s announced.  But these are heavily subsidized routes, and the \\noptimistic projections of them have them doubling their share of trade between China and \\nEurope over the next decade.  So doubling sounds like a lot, but it\\'s going from 1.25 percent to \\n2.5 percent. \\n And so if you\\'re in the air freight business, you might be worried about that eating \\ninto the business that you do.  I think the maritime story remains where most of the action is, in \\nlarge part because of many of the challenges that you pointed out have been shown in colonial \\nhistory with building projects beyond your borders. \\n I think there\\'s also, there\\'s an American parallel too.  Next year is going to be the \\n150th anniversary of the Transcontinental Railway, which it included shady financing.  You \\nknow it led to an economic crisis.  The costs in many respects far exceeded the returns, and so I \\nthink that for all of these reasons, the maritime domain is probably where the real action remains. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  If you want to have, if you want to spread the financial risk, \\nyou ask others to help you finance those projects, and AIIB, for example, is doing just that.  You \\nare making others helping you finance those infrastructure projects because it\\'s good for Asia.  \\nSo you spread the risk among everyone else.  You just, it\\'s not just China taking the financial \\nburden.  That\\'s one point. \\n If those countries can\\'t repay their loans, then you seize their assets.  You ask \\nthem to give you a 99-year lease on your port or you ask them provide oil or gas for a number of \\nyears, for example.  That\\'s another way to have some kind of economic return. \\n The land bridge--sorry-- \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  Sort of plays hell with the whole soft power thing, \\nthough, doesn\\'t it? \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Absolutely. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  I mean it\\'s not really the way to gain influence, \\nseizing assets and, you know, dictating terms.  It hasn\\'t worked all that well for us either. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Absolutely.  Yeah, I am aware.   \\n About the land bridge, I think we should not just focus on the railways.  There are \\nalso pipelines and fiber-optic networks.  I think that\\'s also very important to follow.  We have to \\nthink of it as a very comprehensive network and, you know, if you can control the Internet over \\nthat big area, you have a great advantage also.  It\\'s not just the trains going full one direction and \\nback empty.  I think there\\'s another dimension that we tend to forget. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  Thank you.  Yeah, the energy piece I should have \\nmentioned.  I get that as well.  Thank you. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n Commissioner Cleveland. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Good morning.  I\\'m glad I showed up just to hear \\nBARF.   \\n [Laughter.] \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  So I think I\\'m going to submit questions about \\nyour pie chart, Mr. Hillman, for the record and ask for a breakdown of what you benchmarked in \\nterms of the MDBs versus the Chinese Policy Bank investments.  I\\'d be curious as to what\\'s \\nbehind that. \\n But I don\\'t know that that lends itself to a conversation right now other than could \\n\\n5050\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nyou--any of you--describe in terms of the commercial loans that have been characterized as key \\nto the Chinese Policy Bank lending, what\\'s the range on that?  It\\'s obviously not IDA terms of \\nseven years before you have to start paying back any loan and then potential forgiveness at the \\nend of 21.  What is the nature of the commercial--what is the commercial nature of the loans, and \\ndoes it vary by country; does it vary by type of project?  Do you have any sort of knowledge on \\nthat?  For any of you--sorry.  Yeah. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Yeah.  Thank you.  So happy to provide some further detail on \\nsome of the project comparisons that we\\'ve done with multilateral development banks versus \\nChinese-funded projects. \\n I think with some of the terms I think it does vary.  I think one of the differences, \\nso about three-quarters of Chinese official finance is commercial terms.  So it\\'s going to be \\nhigher interest rates than you would get.  You know, it\\'s not concessional financing like you \\nwould get from an MDB.  So I think there\\'s a difference between the rates.  They\\'re often able to \\ndo that, though, because they\\'re willing to go where those other lenders are not, and I think that\\'s \\nsomething we need to think about because we can criticize and illuminate the risks of pursuing \\nrisky projects, but until you provide better alternatives, I think it\\'s very difficult to persuade \\nsomeone. \\n I mean just put yourself in the shoes of someone considering those offers.  On the \\none hand, you have a project that can start tomorrow that you can announce and have a \\ngroundbreaking ceremony, and, on the other hand, you have warnings about, you know, longer-\\nterm risks.  And I think that we need to think more about providing some better alternatives. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Okay.  Well, presumably that\\'s one of the things \\none hopes that the international institutions step into that, that gap-- \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Certainly. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  --where other people won\\'t want to go.  Maybe if \\nyou could provide some kind of chart that sort of shows, and when it comes to road construction, \\nthis is the kind of loan rate that they\\'re offering over what period of time and what other terms \\nmay be related to it, and if it varies by sector, if it varies by country, I\\'d be curious about what we \\nknow.  And it may not; it may not be much. \\n The second piece of this that I\\'m really interested in, and it was referenced in a \\nstaff memo, and I think in some of your testimony, is that this is as much an initiative about \\nforeign policy and international security interests for China, but it is also very much about \\ndomestic drivers. \\n And I think it was characterized somewhere that every province has a stake in this \\ninitiative. So I\\'m wondering if you all could speak to what that provincial stake is?  Is it anteing \\nup money? Is it an expectation of employment?  Is it skills, expertise?  Kind of what is the \\nprovincial interest or commitment? \\n And then the other piece of it is thinking back to the last time there was an \\ninternal stimulus in China, it ended up being a tax on the provinces because they had to cough up \\nmoney to cover a lot of what the domestic spending expectations were.  So, again, in that \\ncontext, are they, are they being asked to commit or are they seeing this an opportunity?  How \\nwould you characterize the provincial piece of this? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  I\\'ll just make a couple comments on this.  Commissioner \\nCleveland, if I could return just briefly to your previous question, I just wanted to add, I know \\nthis is the point of what are the terms of the deals and sort of it harkens to a more broader issue \\nabout the transparency of the deals.  I know it\\'s a point of frustration for a number of us on the \\n\\n5151\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nground in Beijing to include folks at our embassy there and other embassies who have tried to \\nlook into this to understand better how their companies might compete. \\n There\\'s, what we\\'re seeing is almost a two-tier situation.  On the one hand, you \\nhave AIIB, which is by all indications operating quite well and by multinational standards and \\nChina\\'s intense work, and Jin Liqun is very well respected head of that organization.  They\\'ve \\nhired good people, and it\\'s out there to be seen as the showpiece of this. \\n The problem is-- \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  As you note, it\\'s not competitive when you look at \\nit dollar for dollar, as to what the-- \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Dollar for dollar, you\\'re absolutely right. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  I mean it\\'s relatively small in terms of what they\\'ve \\ninvested in. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Exactly.  But from a transparency and how they\\'re operating-- \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Right. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  --so far so good.  The problem is most of the money is coming \\nout of China Development Bank and China Ex-Im, and it\\'s incredibly frustrating for a lot of \\npeople on the ground to try to get insight into how these deals are being done across the board. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Maybe there\\'s a chart that somebody could \\nproduce that shows all of the deals and whether or not there is transparency because sometimes \\nthe lack of information when it\\'s made public is-- \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Absolutely. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  --useful.  So-- \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  I think the transparency part of this is critical, and I mean it\\'s a \\nhuge challenge for researchers, but it\\'s a practical challenge too for people who want to \\nparticipate in these projects. \\n So we have, on our website, we have a page for each project that we track, and \\nthere\\'s a number of data fields on each project page.  So as an experiment, one of the things we \\ndid was we basically gave each page a report card, how much information do you have, and it \\nwas a little bit surprising.  We actually, the Chinese lenders and the MDBs came out all sort of in \\nthe B to B minus category. \\n But I think it\\'s very difficult to know about the things that you\\'re not aware of; \\nright?  And so a trend that we have observed is that some of the China Development Bank \\nprojects, in particular, that we have, we don\\'t know about them when they\\'re in their earliest \\nstages.  We know about them when they\\'re further along, and the earlier stages is where the \\nopportunities are to sort of become involved. \\n And it\\'s also the opportunity to know what the terms are and to do your due \\ndiligence on that. So I think the transparency issue is key and hopefully something that, you \\nknow, those institutions will improve on and something we should ask them to improve on as \\nwell. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Provincial issue? \\n MS. ROLLAND:  I\\'m not so familiar with the financial burden that the provinces \\nhave to take on because of that.  But from the central government perspective, the idea is really \\nto try to reduce the development gap between the coastal provinces that are more developed and \\nthe landlocked ones, some sort of prolongation of what happened around the 2000s when they \\nstarted to implement the Greater Western Development Plan. \\n\\n5252\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n So now the idea is that instead of having development coming from the eastern \\nshores down to the landlocked provinces, those provinces would be sandwiched between eastern \\ncoast and the entire region, and cross-border trade would also help them growing their own, their \\nown economy and so on.  \\n So reducing the developing gap.  Those provinces have also an increasing--that\\'s \\ninteresting--an increasing role in foreign policy as well.  So, for example, Xinjiang is a dedicated \\nprovince to try to develop ties with the Turkic world, so Central Asia but also Turkey.   \\n Ningxia, which is a Muslim province, has lots of ties with the Gulf countries, for \\nexample, building on this identity of Muslim world.  The southern provinces of Yunnan and \\nGuangxi also have more dedicated ties with Southeast Asia, for example.  So you can see that \\nthey are sort of specializing into building more ties with their closer neighbors, and that\\'s also an \\ninteresting thing to follow. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  A couple of things to say.  Mr. Hillman \\nmentioned his database, and for those of you online or in the audience, this is at the CSIS \\nwebsite, and it\\'s called Reconnecting Asia; am I right? \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Uh-huh. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  So do take a look at that, and it sounds like you \\ncan build in even more along the lines of what our new chairman, Chairman Cleveland, is \\nthinking.  And our vice chairperson is Carolyn Bartholomew.  Left me shift to hear your \\nquestions. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Thank you very much, and thank you to \\nall of our witnesses both for being here today and for your service for your respective \\ngovernments over the years.  We think we\\'ve all benefited from that. \\n I just want to note that this is clearly an important issue and one we\\'re going to \\nkeep talking about.  Our ranks up here are a little depleted today.  We have two people, two \\ncommissioners on the disabled list, and one whose flight was canceled first thing this morning.  \\nOtherwise we would have a more fulsome participation. \\nA couple of things.  One is can you talk a little bit about what you think Beijing--what \\nconstitutes success for Beijing of this Belt and Road Initiative?  I\\'ll just say also while we ask \\nyou to focus on Belt and Road, it\\'s very difficult for me to look at any of this without also \\nthinking about China\\'s moves in Africa and in Latin America. That it\\'s all part of the \"going out\" \\nstrategy or whatever we call it.  So there\\'s a piece of it, but I have a tendency to think of these \\nother filters. That\\'s one thing. \\n Another is I know, Mr. Phillips, you talked particularly about cash, but what \\nabout the debt, the debt loads that the countries who are getting these projects are going to be \\nfacing?  When we were in Hanoi a couple of years ago, you know, we heard a lot of complaint \\nabout projects already behind schedule, over budget, which meant the debt burden was going to \\nincrease, and being poorly made. \\n So what I\\'d like to think about, again, what constitutes success for Beijing in these \\nprojects, but also what are the implications for the countries who are the recipients?  And we\\'ll \\ntie in there--Ms. Rolland, I\\'m glad you mentioned the fiber optics issues because, of course, \\nthere\\'s a very real possibility that China\\'s Great Firewall is ultimately what succeeds or \\nessentially is extended or implemented in all of these other countries, which reduces the ability \\nof the people in those countries to raise questions about how their leaders are dealing with China.  \\nIn fact, we\\'ll go into some of the geostrategic things that were things.  \\n So I\\'m trying to look at it from both levels that, what, by 2049, what would a \\n\\n5353\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nsuccessful BRI look like?  Even by 2025, what would it look like?  And what are the \\nimplications for the countries, the challenges that they\\'re facing?  Is this just another new \\ncolonialism? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  Thank you very much for those questions, and particularly \\nto your first point, what is success has been something in the front of my mind from the very \\nbeginning of this.  I think this is such a beautiful political program that it\\'s beyond belief.  Why?  \\nBecause you can define success any way you want.  There\\'s no end date; there\\'s no target dates.   \\n Arguably, Beijing could say today that\\'s successful, and it is for many of the \\nreasons we\\'ve talked about already of just the ability to bring those many, that many leaders to \\nBeijing in May and national level delegations and have the ability for Chinese firms to have the \\nextension and the development of soft power they already have is arguably success. \\n So the beauty of it is there is no end target date.  There is no hard and fast \\nobjective or criteria that anybody can really lay on this to say did you meet what you said you \\nwere going to do or not because they haven\\'t really said what they\\'re going to do. \\n Now your point about the debt is I think as critical.  I think it\\'s been pointed out \\nearlier that there are some real land mines in that and problems that some places are already \\nexperiencing. Look at Sri Lanka, for example.  Just some of the projects that weren\\'t even called \\nBelt and Road before that are sort of that now have already caused debt issues that become \\npolitical problems internally and then become a bilateral issue with China, and then it\\'s going to \\ndepend on how China reacts to that. \\n Do they seize assets?  Do they try to come out with more concessionary terms?  I \\nthink that\\'s, that\\'s one of the real areas to watch as this unfolds. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Thank you. \\n So Sri Lanka was just mentioned, and I think it\\'s a fascinating case of both some \\nof the rewards for China even when things go wrong, and so, you know, in the southern part of \\nSri Lanka, which I had an opportunity to visit just a few weeks ago, there\\'s a port at Hambantota \\nthat we\\'re probably all familiar with that was built by Chinese contractors with Chinese \\nfinancing, and then when the government couldn\\'t pay back the loan, China took equity in the \\nport.  They now have a 99-year lease, and this is in a very strategic area of the world that\\'s, you \\nknow, miles from some of the busiest shipping lanes. \\n And if you go there today, it\\'s, you know, kind of on lockdown.  It\\'s been handed \\nover to Chinese companies to run, but there\\'s not a lot of economic activity there, and it\\'s a \\ndramatic contrast.  It\\'s like night and day between that port and the port in Colombo where there \\nis lots of, you know, cargo vessels coming in and out. \\n In Hambantota, you can look into the Indian Ocean and see large vessels going by \\nin the distance, but none of them are coming in, and I think that\\'s not going to be great for Sri \\nLanka in the longer term because, you know, this was sold as a development program for an area \\nthat had been hit by a natural disaster, for an area that had been traditionally undeveloped. \\n And I think we also need to be careful about how we respond to this now that it \\nhas happened so there are proposals to develop yet another port in Sri Lanka on the eastern side \\nin Trincomalee, and this is a, I mean naturally there\\'s World War II history there, naturally a very \\nbeautiful port, and there\\'s interest among some outside countries--Japan and India among them--\\nin maybe developing that. \\n From a debt perspective, that might make the problem worse for Sri Lanka unless \\nit\\'s done in the right way.  And so I think we need to be, we need to be careful that as this \\ncompetition continues, these debt issues are handled correctly, and that we\\'re not by trying to fix \\n\\n5454\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthe problem adding, you know, even more, even more debt to a small economy. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  There\\'s a word that has come back in several of the \\ncommissioners\\' comments this morning.  It\\'s colonialism.  I think we tend to see what China is \\ndoing through our own lenses and through our own experience.  I think in Beijing\\'s eyes, it\\'s not \\nabout colonialism.  It\\'s about \"all under heavens.\"  \\n I was struck when I was doing my research about this project about how \\neverything goes back to historical references to maybe a mythical past really, a mythical history \\nwhere China was, you know, the empire was respected by its neighbors and had some diplomatic \\nties with the region, going also through the tributary system. \\n Some scholars in China and the strategic thinkers frankly refer to that past when \\nthey talk about Belt and Road.  So, and people tend to be very skeptical about that.  Who would \\nwant to be a vessel state to China nowadays in 21st century?  How is this possible?  It\\'s a myth. \\n I think we\\'re starting actually to see this already.  So the Belt and Road Forum, \\nthe famous BARF, that we all like a lot, I think was a very, very symbolic of that sort of tributary \\nsystem.  People didn\\'t kowtow and didn\\'t put their head on the floor in front of Xi Jinping, but \\nthey came with gifts, MOUs, and in return for that, they got access.  They got investment.  They \\ngot protection. \\n I think this is the kind of mindset that you need to think about when you\\'re \\nthinking about Belt and Road.  It\\'s a different--it\\'s a different thing that we\\'re looking at.  Again, \\nit\\'s foreign, but it doesn\\'t mean that it doesn\\'t work. \\n If you look also at companies, big companies that are being silenced on the fact \\nthat they cannot write Taiwan as a country on their website or whatever, that\\'s also part of, I \\nthink, a 21st century \"all under heaven\" system.  So I think the vision and what constitutes \\nsuccess for Beijing, as Randal Phillips said, it\\'s already happening.  It\\'s already successful.  \\nPeople are paying attention.  China\\'s image, global image, is really enhanced. \\n This is a fantastic project and people are talking about it.  There\\'s no leader \\naround the world that is not paying attention to China\\'s proposal and starting to think about how \\nthey can get some benefit from it.  Just that--just that is very important. \\n So in the end, I think the vision is also a reflection of China\\'s uneasiness with the \\ncurrent international order.  More and more the Chinese authorities are vocal about how the \\ncurrent order is just U.S.-led and Western-led, and it\\'s unfair to other countries, and China needs \\nto do more to transform it and to reform it so that China and the developing world has more say, \\nwhich brings me back to the digital Silk Road and how this is going to have a geopolitical \\nimpact. \\n There, too, I think the physical infrastructure is just part of what Belt and Road is \\nabout.  So you might have fiber optic networks around the region that are laid by Chinese \\ncompanies that in itself has to be under scrutiny on our side.  But it\\'s also about the narrative that \\nthose networks project to the outside.   \\n There\\'s more and more media cooperation between China and Russia and Iran, et \\ncetera, et cetera.  Those civilians\\' skills that China has implemented inside and domestically can \\nalso be exported outside, and Commissioner Bartholomew, you said something about the Great \\nFirewall.  There is, I think, a strong possibility that those skills are going to be exported also \\naround the region.   \\n And this is also part of what China has been trying to enhance for itself, which is \\nwhat it calls the discursive power.  China needs to make its voice heard and listened to by other \\ncountries, and Belt and Road has provided China with just that.  I think we\\'re hearing China\\'s \\n\\n5555\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nvoice more than ever before. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  If I could just add one piece on that.  I think this is very \\nimportant whether it\\'s on the fiber optic side or any of the other industries of the Made in China \\n2025 industrial policy, which is basically, as you all know, ten broad categories of industry that \\nare at the heart of 21st century economy, the economy today and tomorrow that are obviously \\nvery important to our economy. \\n That can\\'t be seen in isolation from Belt and Road Initiative because if Belt and \\nRoad Initiative is even somewhat successful, it sets out the broad framework for China to further \\ncompete well and grasp the, as they call it, the commanding heights of those industries, which \\nare going to further be detrimental to our ability to compete in those industries. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Just to add, both, detrimental both to \\nour abilities to compete but also to the abilities of dissenting voices to be able to speak up and be \\nheard. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Well said.  Commissioner Stivers, please. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Thank you.  Thank you all for being here today \\nand for just excellent work you\\'ve done on this issue and, in particular, the focus that you\\'ve had \\non the noninfrastructure side of the Belt and Road Initiative because I would say 80 to 90 percent \\nof the literature that\\'s written about Belt and Road is about the infrastructure part of it.  \\n And this other part on the high tech, the telecommunications, I think is more of a \\nconcern for the rest of the international community than the infrastructure part of it although \\nthey\\'re both concerned.  Angela Merkel just said, I think yesterday, that data is the raw material \\nof the 21st century, and the question of who owns the data will decide in the end whether \\ndemocracy, a participatory social model, and economic prosperity can be combined. \\n And, of course, there\\'s major implications if, you know, the fastest growing \\nregion of the world with two-thirds of the world\\'s people and half of the world\\'s GDP is \\ndominated by Huawei as the major telecommunications provider for that region and Baidu as the \\ndominant GPS satellite for that region.  And how do you compete with that?  \\n I mean there\\'s so much incentives provided by the Chinese government through \\nMade in 2025 and a host of other things.  You know I know we compete on infrastructure, the \\nJapanese can, the Koreans can, the World Bank can, the Asian Development Bank can.  They \\nneed more help certainly, but I see a healthy competition on infrastructure if the international \\ncommunity, you know, is up to it. \\n But on the high-tech side, can we compete? And how? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that\\'s an exceptionally important issue that\\'s probably \\nworthy of yet another hearing.  I think it goes certainly on the subsidy--the cash side of this is \\ncertainly important.  But also as a lot of my colleagues in Beijing would comment and have been \\nfor a number of years--standards has been something.  Patent standards, the who sets the rules of \\nthe road.  China has been working diligently for years now, very successfully, in using their \\nmarket power, just their domestic market power, to be able to change that dynamic and force a \\nnumber of companies into accepting standards that they might not otherwise have to do. \\n And that market power is only being expanded now with Belt and Road Initiative \\nin a sense, but that is absolutely playing into, particularly the technology piece, of the \\ncompetitiveness.  And so we\\'re often seeing now concerns about how China is coercing \\ntechnology transfer as part of the ability to have market access in China.  That is only going to \\ngrow with this, this process. \\n\\n5656\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n That is going to absolutely affect how some of our best companies are able to \\ncompete in that market and beyond and will set the stage for how they have to deal with partners \\nelsewhere. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Thank you. \\n I also think that the standards part must be part of the solution, and I think that, \\nyou know, that\\'s done through a number of fora, and, you know, standard setting is done both \\nwith partners and allies, but it\\'s also done through the U.S. leadership position in multilateral \\ninstitutions, and so I think it\\'s important to sustain our leadership in those institutions, and I think \\nit\\'s important to also expose instances when standards are not met, and tell those stories about the \\nconsequences of adopting, you know, lower standards, the consequence of adopting lower \\nquality instead of paying for higher quality up front. \\n And I do think, though, even though I mean I agree entirely about the importance \\nof data, I think some of these standards questions, the data and the infrastructure go hand-in-\\nhand.  The infrastructure building is often a conduit through which standards are accepted and \\nspread, and so I think that we need to, as Nadège was mentioning earlier, consider this \\nholistically, both the data side and the infrastructure that makes the data possible. \\n I don\\'t think the solution is to, you know, meet China head on with our own \\nsubsidies.  We\\'re not going to out-China China.  And I think that we need to focus on what we\\'re \\ngood at and what our companies are good at, which is providing reliable products, which is \\nupholding standards, many of which exist and need to be enforced. \\n Thank you. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Just very--sorry, Ms. Rolland.  Mr. \\nPhillips, I just wanted you to know that we actually are having a hearing in April where the \\nstandards issue will be being brought up. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Outstanding.  Well done. \\n [Laughter.] \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  What\\'s the date? \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Oh, I don\\'t know if we have a date.  Do \\nwe have a date?  Oh, it\\'s March.  Sorry, it\\'s March.  I was wrong.  It was March 8. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Ms. Rolland. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  No.  I just wanted to just reinforce what has been said.  I fully \\nagree on that.  I want to go a little bit beyond that and think about not just the industrial standards \\nand all the international standards but also in terms of intellectual leadership.  China has been \\noffering tens of thousands of scholarships for students to go study in China--students from Belt \\nand Road countries.  And that\\'s part of one of the five pillars of Belt and Road.  It\\'s about people-\\nto-people exchanges. \\n And in my mind those scholarships are not just for students to come, learn \\nChinese, but it\\'s also, I believe, a way to train the elites of these countries so maybe in the long \\nrun there will be a better understanding between China and those political and military elites in \\nthe region through those people-to-people exchanges and scholarships. \\n So when you think about standards, it\\'s not just about industrial and high-tech \\nstandards. It\\'s also about training future generation of leaders in the region. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  If I can ask one more question.  On the role of \\ncivil society, what we have, you know, one of the big advantages of international development \\nbest practices is that they engage with--it\\'s supposed to at its best engage with the people more so \\nthan the government. There\\'s always a role for both, but you don\\'t see China doing that as much. \\n\\n5757\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n Their deal is with the government.  They\\'re not transparent, and the people are \\noften an afterthought, which has gotten a lot of these projects in trouble.  I think the two, you \\nknow, major openings that have happened in the region, in Sri Lanka and in Burma, have had a \\ndirect correlation to China\\'s development projects in those two countries, and I think that \\ncorrelation is significant. \\n So are Chinese leaders kind of understanding the role of civil society in these \\ncountries more?  Are they becoming more sophisticated in that engagement part of it?  Or do \\nthey just not get that part of it?  Because obviously the success of their projects are going to need \\nto have that engagement from the people who are affected or the different, or civil society in \\nthese countries in order for them to be effective. Are they making changes in the way they\\'re \\naddressing these projects or not so much? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  It\\'s a yes and no.  Yes, in that certainly the people who are \\nwhether it\\'s in the foreign ministry or other agencies of government who are involved with this \\nprocess or the key state-owned enterprises, and they\\'re seeing it on the front end that, yes, they \\nhear the complaints about whether it\\'s Chinese labor for the projects or seeing benefits filter \\ndown to local society and realizing that maybe they need to have at least a perceived lighter \\nhand. \\n But I\\'d go back to the point that was raised earlier about China just sees this \\nprocess differently than we see it through our eyes coming back to the colonialist aspect of this. \\n They genuinely through their own internal dialogue and rhetoric and belief is that \\nit\\'s-- China\\'s a great country and others are lesser countries, and it doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re bad.  \\nIt\\'s just that they\\'re lesser.  And that China is doing good by this and that others ought to be \\nthankful for that, and therefore they\\'re less concerned about the civil society piece of this than we \\nmight think. \\n And I\\'m not making that as a value judgment.  It\\'s just they don\\'t quite see it as a \\nheavier burden than others might see it. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  I think that it\\'s a trial and experiment and learning process.  \\nYou know we need to remind ourselves that this is quite new for China.  This is a big \"going \\nout\" on steroids strategy.  So yes, they\\'ve done that before in Africa, and they also came across \\nsome problems there, and I think they have learned from it. \\n The same as their relation with government.  You know, traditionally I think that \\nthe central authorities in China tended, used to privilege their relationship with the actual \\ngovernment without looking or forming bonds with opposition parties or other members of the \\npolitical elites. \\n Over the years I think China has improved this capacity to know better different \\nactors in the countries and not just focus on the government. And similarly I think now being \\naware of that importance of civil society, I think they\\'re also trying to reach out to those, to those \\ngroups in a different way. \\n I think there\\'s, here it\\'s more bottom up approach, probably coming from the \\nSOEs themselves or the firms that are actually operating on the ground and trying to at their level \\nfigure out how to be more engaging with the local people.  And I think they\\'re trying to set up \\nsome good standards of behavior for their workers and trying to maybe employ local workers so \\nthat they can also be engaged in the project itself.  So raising the benefit for the local people as \\nwell.  So, yeah, learning. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Do you think they\\'re doing that? \\n MS. ROLLAND:  I think they\\'re, I think they\\'re trying.  I think they\\'re trying.  I \\n\\n5858\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthink, again, it\\'s not like they\\'re oblivious to what\\'s going on.  I think they know in different \\ncountries what happened, and they learned from it, and then I don\\'t think they\\'re going to repeat \\nthat mistake afterwards. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Let me--we have a couple more questions we \\ncan get out before this panel closes.  And I think it\\'s very important for us to hear from each of \\nyou on, as you know, our responsibility is to report to Congress with recommendations, and so \\nwe\\'ve talked about what it means for Beijing or China to be successful. \\n What does the United States do?  What does Congress in particular do in order for \\nus to successfully navigate, counterbalance, or what, the next 30 years?   \\n I\\'d also like, Mr. Phillips, if we have time, for you to comment on what American \\ncompanies should do because I know that\\'s a particular area of expertise. \\n So why don\\'t we start with Mr. Hillman.  If you could hit it, you know, hit it home \\nand tell us specifically--we have many committees here--what needs to happen here in \\nWashington and beyond? \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Thank you. \\n So I think in many ways the best response to Belt and Road is not a response at \\nall.  It\\'s a more compelling U.S. vision and I think it\\'s been encouraging that there\\'s been support \\nbuilding for the free and open Indo-Pacific concept, but I think more needs to be done to \\noperationalize that, and I think, you know, at the end of the day resources matter more than \\nrhetoric. \\n I think there\\'s a series of things that Congress could do to help operationalize that \\nconcept, which isn\\'t the entirety of Belt and Road. Belt and Road goes other places.  But that \\ndoes seem to be the sort of central opportunity right now.  \\n I think one thing that could be done is, you know, instructing the administration to \\ncome up with principles and standards for quality infrastructure.  That term gets thrown around a \\nlot--quality--and I think there are competing definitions for what it means, not only in terms of \\noutcomes but even more difficult to define the necessary processes that get you to those \\noutcomes. I think that\\'s something that we can develop also with partners and allies. \\n And then again I think funding, you know, fully resourcing and maintaining the \\nU.S. leadership position in multilateral development banks.  For the U.S. commercial agencies \\nthat are involved with this, I think that there\\'s, you know, certainly always merit in considering \\ncould we streamline some of what we do and combine functions?  And I know that\\'s a sort of \\nlonger-standing debate that many, some people have tried, and certainly merit in thinking it \\nthrough. \\n I think at the end of the day the basic functions need to be there, and we need to \\nsupport them.  China has a whole host of tools that a lot of which have been mentioned today \\nthat it uses to advance the Belt and Road.  I think the minimum that we can do is give our \\ncommercial, U.S. commercial agencies what they need to operate. \\n And I think, you know, beyond that, I think the U.S. goal should really be not to \\nthrow federal money at, you know, a Marshall Plan for Asia or something like that, but in setting \\nthese standards and building support for them.  I think we can catalyze more private sector \\ninvestment. \\n There\\'s about, you know, $100 trillion in institutional funds that are looking for \\nreliable long-term returns.  Many of these areas are very risky, and I\\'m under no illusion that \\nlarge chunks of that treasure chest are going to go to projects in some of the places we\\'re talking \\nabout. \\n\\n5959\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n But I think more can, and I think more can by having the U.S. play a more \\nproactive role in setting standards and managing some risks.  And ultimately that gets toward \\nproviding better alternatives for the recipient countries who are considering these offers.  You \\nknow, on the one hand, something that starts tomorrow.  On the other hand, something that might \\ntake a little while longer, might cost a little more up-front, but will, you know, give you a better \\nreturn in the longer run. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Ms. Rolland. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Yes.  Thank you.  I think the first step you\\'re doing already, is \\nbringing awareness, you know, to what\\'s going on so that we can see what we can do.  This is not \\na small thing. This is a very important one. \\n The second thing I think is keeping open the possibility of giving alternatives to \\nthese countries.  China is really going out to develop mostly developing countries.  And they \\ndon\\'t really have other alternatives, and so I think the U.S. and its allies--that\\'s the European in \\nme that\\'s speaking.  I think this is something that we have to do together. \\nThe U.S. itself won\\'t, has the capacity, but I think this is really something that we have to do in \\ncooperation with its allies in Europe but also in Asia.  India and Japan have started to provide \\nthose alternatives, and I think there\\'s a lot of things that we can, we in the U.S. can do more and \\nbetter in conjunction with those initiatives, again to provide alternatives for these countries. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n Mr. Phillips. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you. \\n I absolutely agree with, I think, as well, the first piece is what we\\'re doing here \\ntoday, and that is the awareness of this and have our eyes wide open.  And again I can\\'t stress \\nenough that we can\\'t look at any of this in isolation.  Belt and Road Initiative, as ambitious and \\nbroad as it is, is also together with Made in China 2025 and other soft power projection of what \\nChina does and is trying to enhance. \\n I mentioned earlier about some of their ability to deal with civil society, et cetera.  \\nThey\\'re quite good in their United Front Work Department, the Party, and across the world in \\nworking with other political parties, civil organizations, to influence.  That\\'s their job in life.  \\nThat\\'s essentially what we\\'re talking about here.  They\\'ll get better at this and do it.  But this is a \\ndeadly serious program.  So we have to have our eyes wide open.   \\n The second thing, at the risk of raising a seriously dead horse here, the Trans-\\nPacific Partnership-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  --or I forget what it\\'s called now.  Justin Trudeau\\'s new \\nComprehensive, it\\'s the CPTPP. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  That is now apparently going to come to fruition with the other \\n11 countries. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  March 8, I think. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  March 8.  Exactly.  We advocated quite heavily for this out of \\nBeijing, and here\\'s why.  It\\'s for this very reason.  It wasn\\'t about trade to those of us on the \\nground in Beijing.  It was about the fundamental principle here that we\\'ve been talking around \\nthis entire hearing, and that is China\\'s market power and its ability to throw its economic weight \\naround to the potential detriment of the United States. \\n How do we compete against that?  The U.S., as powerful as we are and as strong \\n\\n6060\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nof an economy as we are, we are not the size economy as part of the whole in the world that we \\nwere after World War II.  We\\'re not going to be able to win this by throwing money at it.  We\\'re \\ngoing to need allies, and we\\'re going to need to partner with others. \\n And the whole benefit of TPP from our perspective was it changed that \\nfundamental dynamic that is at the heart of all this, that China believes that you need that market \\nmore than they\\'re worried about losing your investment.  So how do you change that? \\n Well, you create a bigger market that China is the odd person out, and now you\\'ve \\ngot 40 percent of the world economy operating at higher standards, a different set of benefits, \\nand suddenly there\\'s an incentive there for China to have to at least moderate some of its \\nbehavior to be able to compete. \\n Now how you get from here to there, that\\'s up to Congress and others to decide \\nhow to do, but that was the only game in town that we saw--the TPP--to be able to at least try to \\nget us from here to there.  So something has to get us from here to there.  And hopefully we\\'ll \\nhave more hearings on that. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  So I think the question about American \\ncompanies, we can hold to an offline conversation because I know Commissioner Stivers has a \\nburning question.  No, go ahead, please.  We have time. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Sure.  Yes, I have a lot of questions.  But since \\nwe\\'re talking about TPP and trade, let\\'s get into that a little bit without getting into the trade, \\nwhether for or against it sort of thing. \\n One of the things, I mean you all mentioned, I think some of you mentioned that \\nthe Belt and Road Initiative was a response to the Asia pivot or the rebalance.  And, you know, \\nChina\\'s leaders were worried about that.  The problem I\\'ve always seen from the rebalance is that \\nTPP was the only significant economic component of it.  And China recognizes the value of \\ndevelopment.  Asian countries, they want development probably more than trade.   \\n And the question is we didn\\'t have a strong enough development component, and \\nI think of OPIC, you know, where you have a U.S. agency that can help underwrite loans and \\nbrings money back to the Treasury.  It doesn\\'t cost the U.S. government a thing, but yet it can \\nhelp some of our companies make the investments and compete in the region.   Again, brings \\nback money for the Treasury, but then you have, you know, the new budget eliminates OPIC. \\n Hopefully, I think the administration is coming to understanding the importance \\nof something like that.  But whether it\\'s that, whether it\\'s our traditional foreign assistance that is \\nso much, that is so effective, whether it\\'s humanitarian assistance, whether it\\'s disaster, disaster \\nassistance, health, agriculture, we have an advantage there, and we should be focusing on those \\nthings in Asia. \\n But, you know, I think the development component as a response to what China is \\ndoing is an important thing to think about.  Do you have any thoughts about that? \\n MS. ROLLAND:  I just want to go back to the response to the Asia rebalancing \\npolicy.  It is and it is not.  The idea has been going on for quite awhile in the intellectual elites of \\nBeijing. So--and I think the first mention of this idea, not called Belt and Road but really the \\ncomponents of it, the first one I saw dates back 2001.  So if one thing, the Asia rebalancing \\npolicy maybe has accelerated it, but it didn\\'t--it wasn\\'t born out of this.  That\\'s one, one point. \\n I think it\\'s also why do we see China going out so, so abruptly now?  It\\'s also in \\nreaction I think to what they perceive as a U.S. disengagement in the world, and so they\\'re \\nseizing this opportunity to go out, more forcefully outside. \\n So if the U.S. is more willing to reestablish its credibility as a global leader, that \\n\\n6161\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nwill also have an impact on how China sees its role in the region. \\n For the more economic piece, I\\'ll turn to my colleagues here who know more than \\nI do. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  I agree entirely that withdrawing from TPP was a missed \\nopportunity and one that we continue to pay for.  I think as broad as Belt and Road is, it still is \\nnowhere near a replacement for what that was and could still be. \\n The trade component of Belt and Road is mainly bilateral deals under a large \\nbanner.  So it\\'s not, it\\'s not, it doesn\\'t have that larger market creation, the rule-setting component \\nthat TPP had.  So I do think that that is something worth thinking about. \\n I think your question of foreign assistance and development is also critical.  One \\nof the things that makes Belt and Road so compelling is that it\\'s this positive vision for countries \\nwhose number one priority is development. And so I think until the U.S. provides its own vision-\\n-it need not be framed in opposition to Belt and Road; it needs to be its own positive economic \\nvision--I think that would be the best response. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Closing thought, Mr. Phillips? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you. \\n On the point for the companies that we see on the ground, it\\'s obviously the \\nmarket in China and Asia as a whole is critical to U.S. companies. Any company worth its salt is \\nthere trying to compete, and some are competing very well.  Many are held back by market \\naccess restrictions and other aspects of a fairly closed system in many sectors that we\\'ve talked \\nabout a number of times before.  But the Belt and Road Initiative in this regard is, I think, \\nsymptomatic of the broader issue with China. \\n It\\'s how do you get access to it if you\\'re a U.S. company to compete, and how do \\nyou learn of the opportunities?  How do you partake?  How do you conduct compliance activities \\nto make sure you\\'re doing well by your fiduciary responsibilities, et cetera?  And obviously get a \\nreturn on your investment, make it economically viable. \\n This is something that virtually all of our members in the American Chamber in \\nChina have looked at Belt and Road whether or not--similar to their Chinese counterparts--of is \\nthere something in here for us?  Is there an opportunity?  And they are trying to figure that out. \\n What we\\'ve seen thus far is it\\'s been more on what we\\'d call the software side of \\nthings.  Rather than the major infrastructure players getting the project through the front door, it\\'s \\nsubcontracting for logistics, finance, consulting, et cetera, that kind of piece, and it hasn\\'t been in \\nlarge numbers yet.  It\\'s been very, very small. \\n But then again the overall amount of enacted Belt and Road projects really hasn\\'t \\nbeen all that great as of yet.  So I think it\\'s still to be seen how much U.S. companies are able to \\ncompete in this.  But it, again, comes down to providing a framework for U.S. companies to \\ncompete effectively and have sustainability to compete going forward. \\n And that\\'s where we\\'re going to have come up with a construct in dealing with the \\nentity that is China and the system and the market power that they are utilizing right now to be \\nable to compete against that.  And so we\\'re going to have to have allies.  We\\'re going to have set \\nup a cooperative framework for companies to talk to each other and to be able to know that we\\'re \\npushing back as a government on issues of real concern when there\\'s coerced technology \\ntransfer, lack of protection for IP, patents and standards issues that are problematic, and just \\nsimple reciprocal market access. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  So we will continue this rich conversation \\ntoday, and I\\'ll have to unfortunately bring this panel to a close, and we will convene again in ten \\n\\n6262\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nminutes for going deeper at the next topic, which is the geostrategic and the military drivers. \\n Thank you very much, all three of you.

SHEA \\n \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Good morning.  We will reconvene for our second panel.  Our \\nsecond panel today looks at the geostrategic and military drivers and implications of the One \\nBelt One Road Initiative.  Now we have a fantastic panel of experts, unfortunately, one of whom \\nhas that infamous flu bug.  Joel Wuthnow will not be with us today unfortunately so we\\'re left \\nwith two--but two really good ones. \\n We will begin with Ely Ratner.  Dr. Ratner is the Maurice R. Greenberg Senior \\nFellow for China Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.  Prior to this position, Dr. Ratner \\nserved as the Deputy National Security Advisor to Vice President Joe Biden, covering the global \\nportfolio with a particular focus on Asia and China policy. \\n Dr. Ratner will provide testimony on the geostrategic and military drivers of BRI \\namid intensifying strategic competition between the United States and China as Beijing\\'s global \\ninfluence grows. \\n We will then hear from Daniel Kliman.  Dr. Kliman is a Senior Fellow in the Asia \\nPacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \\n Before joining CNAS, Dr. Kliman worked in the Office of the Under Secretary of \\nDefense for Policy where he served as Senior Advisor for Asia Integration.  Dr. Kliman will \\nprovide testimony on China\\'s efforts to expand its security presence around the Indian Ocean \\nRim and across Eurasia, how these efforts relate to BRI, and implications and options for the \\nUnited States. \\n Thank you all very much for your testimony.  I\\'m supposed to admonish you to \\nkeep your testimony to seven minutes, but since we\\'re down to two, take your time and say what \\nyou want to say.  So thank you. \\n We\\'ll start with Dr. Ratner. \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n6464\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF ELY RATNER \\nMAURICE R. GREENBERG SENIOR FELLOW FOR CHINA STUDIES, COUNCIL ON \\n\\nFOREIGN RELATIONS \\n \\n\\nDR. RATNER:  Mr. Commissioner, thank you so much.   \\n It\\'s a great opportunity to be here today. You should never give think tankers \\nmore time to talk. \\n [Laughter.] \\n DR. RATNER:  Just as a pro tip.  But I\\'ll try to be--I will try to be as close to that \\nas I can and we can come back.  I\\'m just going to hit the wave tops of my written testimony. \\n Let me just start with the contextual point of the overall trend lines, which I began \\nmy written testimony with, which I think overhangs any discussion of the Belt and Road \\nInitiative, which is four points: \\n Number one, the United States and China are locked in a consequential \\ngeopolitical competition right now that will determine the character of the 21st century; \\n Number two, the United States is losing that competition right now and increasing \\nthe likelihood not just that the U.S.-led liberal order will be undermined, but that a China-led \\ndominated region will emerge; \\n Third, the United States government has failed to approach this competition with \\nanything approximating its seriousness to date, and I say that as a former official; \\n And fourth, despite that and despite current trends, the United States can arrest \\nChina\\'s momentum here and prevent the growth of an illiberal order in Asia if we put our \\nstrategy and our resources and our attention that are deserved to this set of issues. \\n So I wanted to put that on the table first.  I know you\\'ve spoken already about the \\neconomic drivers and imperatives of the Belt and Road Initiative.  I do think those are in many \\nways primary, but the military and the geostrategic effects are quite significant and barely below \\nthe surface and definitely worthy of consideration. \\n So, again, thank you for convening this important discussion. \\n I\\'m going to talk about three things briefly.  Number one, the security benefits, the \\nadvantages that China is deriving from Belt and Road.  Second, the security risks that are going \\nto emerge for China.  And then finally some recommendations for U.S. policy in response. \\n As it relates to the benefits, I think you\\'ve already spoken about energy security, \\nwhich the Chinese obviously see not just as an economic issue but as a military issue as well.  \\nThe diversified trade routes for energy imports is I think the most direct and indisputable \\nstrategic benefit for the Chinese from the Belt and Road, allowing them to avoid the Malacca \\nStraits and other choke points where U.S. and partners have significant military capability to \\ndisrupt those flows. \\n The second benefit potentially relates to China counterterrorism efforts insofar as \\nat least from their perspective greater development in some of these impoverished areas may \\nalleviate some of the drivers of terrorism, but it will also allow them to enhance their \\nrelationships with countries in South and Central Asia and the Middle East with which they will \\nwork with and through in their own counterterrorism efforts as it relates to their concerns about \\npotential instability in Western China. \\n Third, overseas military access and presence.  The Chinese government is actively \\nseeking overseas bases to be rotating military forces through, and I would foresee that both the \\nPeople\\'s Liberation Army and the People\\'s Armed Police will gain increased access in BRI \\n\\n6565\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nrecipient countries over time. \\n Four, BRI will feed, and you may have spoken about this earlier as well, the \\nemergence of a more illiberal regional security order in which democracy and individual rights \\nwill be largely subservient to economic growth and social stability, and the strategic and military \\nissues around which international or regional intervention will be occurring will be around those \\nilliberal aims rather than the types of multilateral interventions that the United States has favored \\nfor individual rights and freedoms and otherwise, particularly since the end of the Cold War. \\n And then, finally, and I think this is the most important but in some ways the most \\namorphous, BRI will afford China greater coercive capacity over security matters.  And so Belt \\nand Road is important for security, not directly because of the military capabilities that it will \\nafford, but rather because it will create a perception of a China-led economic order in Asia, and \\nthat has all sorts of cascading effects upon the decision-making of other countries, whether to or \\nhow far they want to partner with the United States, and how willing they are to push back \\nagainst certain forms of Chinese coercion or assertiveness if doing so will face both the loss of \\npotential rewards through BRI or economic punishment and coercion. \\n So I think those are the top five security benefits for China. \\n As it relates to risks, clearly terrorism is one that will emerge as China has greater \\ninvestments and more personnel overseas.  The possibility of, again, attacks against Chinese \\nnationals or business interests will increase insofar as the types of projects that they will be \\nfunding will be highly symbolic, highly politically salient, probably politically controversial, and \\nquite soft targets in many ways.  So ripe for a terrorist threat. \\n Second in terms of security risks will be what I would characterize as domestic \\nstability or--sorry--instability in recipient countries.  Insofar as China has had a historical \\nrhetorical position anyhow of not interfering in the domestic politics of other countries, if they \\nhave major $100 million investments, and if Xi Jinping\\'s legitimacy and reputation is on the line, \\nthat\\'s going to change very quickly. \\n And so the domestic political stability and social stability of the--in BRI recipient \\ncountries will become a first order priority for the Chinese, and they will start bearing the \\nsecurity costs of that in terms of both assisting BRI recipient countries in securing their domestic \\npopulations as well as I would suspect over time intervening directly themselves. \\n And then, finally, as it relates to the geostrategic issues and the risks for China, \\nBeijing will despite its best efforts for sure be stepping into regional rivalries that it would like to \\navoid, and it will be doing so in two ways. \\n Number one--and we\\'re already seeing this in the Pakistan-India context--China\\'s \\nprojects will be weighing in on regional rivalries, whether it\\'s again between Pakistan and India \\nor between Iran and Saudi Arabia, that will be very difficult for Beijing not to feel like it\\'s taking \\na side, and again that will draw it into these picking sides in a way it hasn\\'t wanted to in the past. \\n And then, finally, of course, if you look at the map, BRI almost immediately starts \\nentering areas which both Moscow and New Delhi consider parts of their sphere of influence.  \\nSo perhaps Russia is slower than India, but these countries will for sure be seeing greater \\nconcerns in terms of that, that front. \\n Let me just take a couple more minutes then if I do have just a little bit of extra \\ntime to think about recommendations for U.S. policy and happy to come back to any of these. \\n The first point I would make--not a specific recommendation--would just be I \\nwould argue the United States does not need a counter-Belt and Road strategy.  The United \\nStates needs a comprehensive and competitive China strategy.  And so I don\\'t think we should \\n\\n6666\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthink about differentiating the problems and the challenges and opportunities that are associated \\nwith BRI somehow cabined from a whole set of issues associated with China\\'s emerging \\ninfluence.  So I would think about it comprehensively.  \\n But the five areas that I highlighted--and why don\\'t I save the details on this for \\nthe question and answer--the first absolute major point, and this is based upon research that I \\nhave done over the last several years, would be that to the extent that China is growing its force \\nprojection capabilities and its footprint globally, it still remains that the most important theater in \\nterms of the United States\\' ability to deter and contain that threat is in East Asia. \\n So that if you\\'re worried about Chinese naval bases in Pakistan, the way you deal \\nwith that problem is by staying competitive in East Asia.  Absolutely first and foremost.  And the \\nTrump administration\\'s national defense strategy made that point in terms of the fact that we \\nhave some catching up to do there, and I would just add that the South China Sea is central to \\nthat--an area where our strategic position is slipping--and again if you\\'re thinking about China\\'s \\nability to project political and military power beyond its shores, its immediate periphery is the \\nabsolute priority where we should be focused right now. \\n Second, the United States should rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership or its latest \\nrendition.  Without an alternative put forward by the United States, that perception of China-led \\neconomic order will persist, and there won\\'t be all the military hardware in the world to shape the \\ndecision-making of our partner countries if they see China as their economic future.  So the \\nUnited States needs to lead on trade and economics. \\n Third, I believe the Trump administration or their successor should think seriously \\nabout what I would characterize as a burden-shifting strategy.  We talk about burden-sharing \\nwith countries like China.  I think more actively we should be thinking about burden-shifting.  In \\nareas where the United States is overextended, where we\\'re bearing a disproportionate level of \\ncosts and where China has emerging security interests, we should think about unilaterally \\ndrawing down and forcing them to fill that void whether that\\'s a consensual agreement or not. \\n Last two points, very quickly.  The United States needs to invest much more in \\nrebuilding its information operations and broadcasting.  The Broadcasting Board of Governors \\nhas done a good job of this as it relates to the Russia problem.  But on the China front, and \\nparticularly as it relates to Belt and Road, which I\\'m sure you heard this morning, there\\'s a lot \\nmore smoke than fire, a lot more about a brand, a lot more about a perception than an economic \\nreality.  \\n The degree to which the United States government can contribute to a separating \\nfact from fiction about what Belt and Road actually is and informing the broader public in some \\nof these countries, all the better. \\n And then the last thing I would add, which may have been raised this morning, is \\nthat the United States in concert with allies and partners should work toward developing \\ncapacity-building for recipient countries to be able to assess themselves the viability of some of \\nthese projects so they don\\'t get stuck in some of these committed debt traps or otherwise that \\nthey may have known better about before. \\n So let me stop there and look forward to your questions.  Thank you so much. \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n6767\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF ELY RATNER \\nMAURICE R.

All statements of fact and \\nexpressions of opinion contained herein are the sole responsibility of the author. \\n\\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\nGeostrategic and Military Drivers and \\nImplications of the Belt and Road \\nInitiative \\nPrepared statement by \\n\\nEly Ratner \\nMaurice R. Greenberg Senior Fellow for China Studies \\nCouncil on Foreign Relations \\n\\nBefore the \\n\\nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\\n2nd Session, 115th Congress \\n\\nHearing on China’s Belt and Road Initiative\\n\\nContext \\nAny discussion of Chinese foreign policy and U.S.-China relations should begin with a baseline description \\nof the overall context and dominant trends. I would offer four topline observations. \\n\\nFirst, the United States and China are now locked in a geopolitical competition, primarily still in Asia. How \\nthis competition evolves will determine the rules, norms, and institutions that govern international relations \\nin the coming decades, as well as levels of peace and prosperity for the United States.  \\n\\nSecond, the United States is losing this competition in ways that increase the likelihood not just of the \\ncrumbling of the U.S.-led order in Asia, but also the rise of a China-dominated region. If such a future in fact \\ncomes to be, the region will be less free, less open, and less inclusive than it is today. Many of America’s \\nforeign policy achievements over the last 75 years will be lost, and it will take generations (at least) to revive \\ncentral elements of today’s liberal international order.  \\n\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\nThird, the U.S. government has failed to approach this competition with anything approximating its \\nimportance for the country’s future. Washington remains distracted and unserious about the China \\nchallenge. The Trump administration sounded some of the right notes in its first National Security Strategy, \\nbut on balance its foreign and domestic policies do not reflect a government focused on projecting or \\nsustaining power and leadership in Asia. \\n\\nFourth, despite current trends, the United States can arrest China’s momentum and prevent the growth of \\nan illiberal order in Asia. The foundations of American power remain strong, while China’s weaknesses are \\nmounting by the day. There is nothing inexorable about either China’s rise or American decline. But neither \\nwill these trends reverse themselves without better policy and strategy in Washington.    \\n\\nThis is the context in which we should consider the military and geostrategic considerations of China’s Belt \\nand Road Initiative (BRI). The United States does not need a counter-BRI strategy; instead, it needs a \\ncomprehensive China strategy to manage the challenges of which BRI is both a cause and symptom.  \\n\\nDrivers and Benefits for China \\nMilitary and geostrategic factors are largely secondary to the economic imperatives of the Belt and Road \\nInitiative.1 The strategy primarily serves China’s efforts to transform and grow its economy amidst the \\nhangover and slowdown of its exhausted manufacturing and investment-led model at home. Beijing hopes \\nto find big projects and new markets for Chinese firms throughout the various belts and roads. \\n\\nHowever, the strategic dimensions of BRI are barely below the surface. The initiative carries strategic \\nsignificance in part because of what it says about Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping’s \\nambitions for China’s role in the world. Xi has quite explicitly retired China’s moderate, cautious foreign \\npolicy and is instead pursuing greater power and leadership on the global stage.2 In that sense, Belt and \\nRoad bears on military and security affairs because it demonstrates Xi’s willingness and desire to pursue big, \\nbold ideas that put China at the center of international politics in ways it has strongly resisted in recent \\ndecades. There is no reason to believe he will cabin these efforts to economic initiatives as China’s military \\nbecomes increasingly capable of projecting power overseas. \\n\\nMoreover, although strategic factors have not been primary motivators, it is still the case that the size, scope, \\nand geography of the initiative are likely to have significant military and geopolitical effects. It will do so \\nboth directly and indirectly, and provide both advantages and risks for Beijing. The possible upshots for \\nChina include the following areas. \\n\\nEnergy security: Diversified trade routes for energy imports are arguably the most direct and indisputable \\nstrategic benefit to China from Belt and Road.3  Beijing is seeking to build roads, ports, and pipelines that \\n\\n1 Nadège Rolland, China’s Eurasian Century?

As a result, BRI will likely include pipelines through Russia and Central Asia, as well as deep water \\nports in South and Southeast Asia.  \\n\\nCounterterrorism: Lack of access and transparency continue to obscure the scope of China’s terrorism \\nproblem in Xinjiang and surrounding provinces. Nonetheless, there have been violent incidents, which are \\nlikely to continue, if not increase, as a result of multiple trends: foreign fighters returning from Syria and \\nIraq; the potential for greater extremist activity in Afghanistan and Central Asia if the United States \\nwithdraws; and growing domestic discontent in western China due to the government’s enhanced \\noppression of Uighur Muslims.4 Chinese officials argue that economic development is an important part of \\nany counterterrorism program. In this telling, extremism in Xinjiang and neighboring countries will abate to \\nthe extent that Belt and Road brings jobs, education, and higher standards of living. \\n\\nOverseas military access and presence: China’s government is actively searching for overseas bases to station \\nand rotate military forces, and the People’s Liberation Army and People’s Armed Police will gain increased \\naccess in BRI countries.5 This will occur in a variety of ways. Chinese forces will be deployed to narrowly \\nprotect high-priority projects. Host countries may also request security assistance to defend against \\ndomestic instability that could imperil vital infrastructure. Finally, in some instances, China is likely to \\nacquire or control major transportation facilities, including ports and airports, in exchange for Chinese \\ninvestment and debt forgiveness. This has already transpired in Sri Lanka and may again soon in Myanmar.6 \\nThe PLA currently lacks the ability to sustain large numbers of troops far from mainland China. This will \\nchange over time with improvements in training, doctrine, and more access to overseas facilities. With naval \\naccess in the Indian Ocean, the PLA will eventually be able to protect and disrupt vital shipping lanes, while \\nalso basing forward submarines and anti-submarine warfare capabilities that could pose a security challenge \\nto regional countries, particularly India. \\n\\nIlliberal regional security order: If Belt and Road proceeds as China envisions, it is likely that an illiberal \\nregional order will develop in which democracy and individual rights are largely subservient to economic \\ngrowth and social stability. China has been hostile to sovereignty violations under the precepts of the liberal \\ninternational order, and is already building an alternative set of rules, norms, and institutions that seek to \\ncircumscribe the ability of the international community to protect and defend individual rights against the \\nwishes of their governments. The point here is not that external intervention will not occur—China has \\nmostly, despite its rhetoric, already abandoned its strict policy of non-interference.7 What it does mean is \\n\\n4 Robbie Gramer, “The Islamic State Pledged to Attack China Next.

It is also likely \\nthat the Eurasian continent overall will become less free and more authoritarian, which is already occurring \\nin places where China has dominant influence.  \\n\\nGreater coercive capacity over security matters: Belt and Road is arguably most important for security issues \\nbecause it creates the perception of a China-led economic order in Asia. As Christopher Johnson at CSIS \\nsuccinctly put it, BRI helps “to reinforce the emerging global narrative that China is moving to the center of \\nglobal economic activity, strength, and influence.”8 This has direct implications for military issues insofar as \\ncountries will be increasingly unwilling to partner with the United States or push back on Chinese \\nassertiveness if they believe it will result in tangible and costly forms of retribution. China is already using \\neconomic carrots and sticks to coerce U.S. allies and partners to reduce security cooperation with the United \\nStates.9 Prominent recent examples include South Korea (over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense \\nmissile defense system) and the Philippines (over disputes in the South China Sea). Countries as far as \\nGreece are carrying Beijing’s water on political matters in the European Union to reap what they expect to \\nbe the spoils of Belt and Road. Beijing’s neutering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \\nover the South China Sea is exemplary of how states and collections of states are likely to defy their national \\nsecurity interests to bend to China’s demands for economic purposes.  \\n\\nSecurity Risks for China \\nChina will face significant, and in many ways new, security challenges as a result of Belt and Road. These \\ninclude terrorism, domestic instability in partner countries, and heightened regional rivalry. China’s \\ngovernment, even if cognizant of these risks, is not curbing its ambitions and lofty rhetoric for Belt and \\nRoad for at least three reasons. First, there is a deeply-held belief in the stabilizing effects of development, \\nsuch that over time a successful BRI will resolve, or at least temper, the most acute security challenges. \\nSecond, Belt and Road is seen in Beijing as part of an overall effort to revive and transform China’s \\nstruggling economy, which is tied to regime legitimacy and social stability. Third, and perhaps most \\nimportantly, Belt and Road is personally important to Xi Jinping and is now closely interlinked with his \\nlegitimacy and legacy. Chinese bureaucrats have therefore taken on an unquestioning, uncritical drive, \\nregardless of the attendant security risks and political fallout likely to emerge. This is all to say that none of \\nthe risks discussed below are likely to weaken Beijing’s enthusiasm and determination over Belt and Road in \\nthe coming years.  \\n\\nTerrorism: Belt and Road will likely raise the potential for acts of terrorism against Chinese nationals and \\nbusiness interests, both at home and abroad in BRI-recipient countries. Many of the proposed \\ntransportation and trade routes pass through areas already suffering from terrorism and insurgency. At the \\nsame time, Chinese overseas investments in the developing world have at times fueled resentment when \\naccompanied by corruption, environmental damage, low labor standards, and few economic benefits for \\nlocal populations. The political exigencies of advancing BRI projects will only increase the likelihood of non-\\neconomically viable projects that result in some combination of wasted resources, mounting debt, and \\nabandoned efforts. This could turn and sharpen more extremist venom toward China. Two additional \\nfactors could animate these trends. First, China’s own extraordinary and deepening oppression of Muslim \\n\\n8 Chris Johnson, “President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, March 2016, p. 2. \\n9 Evan A.

By thrusting its economic future and Xi Jinping’s legitimacy on BRI’s success, China will have an \\noutsized stake in supporting friendly regimes and preserving domestic stability in recipient countries. This is \\nfairly evident transitivity: greater investments leading to greater interests leading to enhanced measures to \\ndefend and protect against security threats to those interests. In the first instance, this will result in China \\nproviding resources to BRI countries to secure high-profile projects. Beijing has said it will rely on partner \\ncountries rather than provide security itself. This is fine in theory, but is unlikely to work: instability already \\nreigns throughout these territories exactly because the host government is unable to provide higher levels of \\nsecurity. China will start with arms sales and technical assistance, but likely will find itself inserting \\npersonnel and its own military hardware into recipient countries before too long. That will put China \\nalongside partner countries putting down insurgencies and suppressing dissent. Moreover, if Chinese \\nnationals or businesses fall victim to political violence in recipient countries, Beijing will face considerable \\ndomestic pressure to respond with force. \\n\\nHeightened regional rivalry: China is fond of presenting its foreign policies as “win-win” and to the benefit of \\nall countries. This was relatively easy to do when China had a small footprint and was not inserting itself in \\nregional affairs outside of its immediate periphery. This will change as China builds strategic infrastructure \\nand extends its influence and power into contested areas and rivalrous regions. Already, the China-Pakistan \\nEconomic Corridor, so far the marque element of BRI, has raised hackles in New Delhi by pursuing \\ninvestments in territory claimed by both India and Pakistan. Permanent or rotational PLA Navy presence at \\nports in the Indian Ocean will also heighten tensions with India. Likewise, projects in the Middle East will \\ninvariably affect the regional competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran.10 Projects in Eastern Europe will, \\neven if inadvertently, put a thumb on the scales between Western Europe, the European Union, and Russia. \\nIn each instance, China’s efforts to not pick sides will become untenable, and Beijing will become \\nincreasingly invested in supporting specific parties. Moreover, China’s influence will envelop areas that \\nIndia and Russia consider within their traditional spheres of influence. This will produce overt competition \\nover third countries when and where interests diverge between Beijing, New Delhi, and Moscow. Military \\nrelations and security assistance are likely to feature as important elements of those contests. \\n\\nRecommendations for U.S. Policy \\nAt least five principles should animate U.S. policy in response to potential strategic implications of Belt and \\nRoad: first, the U.S. security competition with China remains most urgent and intense in East Asia; second, \\neconomics and security are intimately linked and should be considered as essential legs of any policy; third, \\nthe United States needs an affirmative economic agenda in Asia, not just a defensive strategy against the \\nnegative externalities of BRI; fourth, public narratives are as important as the reality on the ground; five, the \\npotential for backlash against China should not create complacency or give the impression that China’s \\ninfluence is not expanding nonetheless. \\n\\n10 Ilan Goldenberg and Ely Ratner, “China’s Middle East Tightrope,” Foreign Policy, April 20, 2015, \\nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/20/china-middle-east-saudi-arabia-iran-oil-nuclear-deal/. \\n\\n73Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nPrevent China from controlling the South China Sea: The analysis above suggests that Belt and Road will draw \\nand allow for greater Chinese military presence overseas, particularly in South and Central Asia. My own \\nresearch on the implications of greater Chinese force projection capabilities arrived at the following \\n(perhaps non-intuitive) conclusion: in response to China’s growing force projection capabilities, the highest \\nstrategic priority for the United States should be ensuring that it remains competitive in East Asia and does \\nnot cede maritime zones within the “First Island Chain” in ways that give China free range to protect forces \\nfrom deep within the South China Sea.11 Belt and Road may solve China’s “Malacca Dilemma,” but it will \\nnot in and of itself alleviate America’s ability to hold the Chinese military at risk along its littoral. I have \\npresented my recommendations elsewhere for a comprehensive strategy for the South China Sea, and will \\nonly say here that current U.S. policy and inattentiveness is abetting ultimate Chinese control of the South \\nChina Sea.12 If brought to conclusion, this will significantly enhance the coercive value of any overseas \\nChinese military presence in the Indian Ocean region. Bottom line: if the United States wants to reduce the \\npotential threat of overseas PLA deployments as a result of BRI, it should focus first and foremost on East \\nAsia, specifically the South China Sea. \\n\\nRejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership: U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) constitutes the \\nTrump administration’s biggest strategic mistake in Asia to date. Heightened concerns over America’s \\ncommitment to the region and greater perceived likelihood of a China-led economic order have quickly \\ncascaded into the security realm.13 As a leading indicator in the South China Sea, regional countries have all \\nbut folded their hands in the absence of an alternative pole of power and influence from the United States. \\nWhere similar dynamics are present, this trend will likely play out repeatedly if and when BRI investments \\nbegin to flow. Although parts of Belt and Road will necessarily fall outside the scope of U.S. efforts to set \\nhigh-standard trade and investment rules, knitting together TPP with the Transatlantic Trade and \\nInvestment Partnership (T-TIP) with Europe would have bracketed both sides of BRI, reducing China’s \\ncoercive boon, resisting the spread of illiberalism, and creating political space for continued security \\ncooperation with the United States. The Trump administration’s strategy of pursuing a “free and open Indo-\\nPacific region” is the right instinct, but will fail without an economic component on par with the scale and \\nscope of TPP. The Trump administration’s approach to revising or even withdrawing from the Korea-U.S. \\nFree Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement will also shape the willingness of \\nU.S. partners to engage in trade negotiations with the United States. The military consequences of BRI will \\nbe substantially larger without U.S. economic leadership in Asia and globally. \\n\\nEngage in active “burden-shifting”: BRI will increase China’s interests in the stability and governance of areas \\nwhere the United States is currently spending considerable resources. Afghanistan is the most obvious \\nexample, followed by Pakistan and parts of the Middle East. U.S. policymakers should map areas where \\nChina’s interests are rising and, concurrently, the United States is overextended or bearing disproportionate \\ncosts.

In fact, much of what China cites as Belt and Road projects either \\npredate the initiative or would have happened anyway in the natural course of China’s economic assistance \\nand activity.14 Chinese officials have also talked about incorporating Latin America and the Arctic into Belt \\nand Road, which would effectively make it simply a moniker for Chinese foreign policy, not a specific set of \\ninitiatives. This calls for more U.S. media and information platforms that can provide a degree of level \\nsetting about the facts and fictions of BRI, as well as the degree of U.S. and other country investment and \\nassistance. Citizens in Southeast Asia, for instance, might be surprised to hear that U.S. and Japanese \\nforeign direct investment in their region is considerably larger than Chinese. Both U.S. officials and U.S.-\\nsupported media can help to paint a more realistic and accurate picture of BRI. High-level statements \\nvoicing concerns about BRI from Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson have been important. The Trump \\nadministration’s sometimes-heard rhetorical formula is a good one: “In a globalized world, there are many \\nbelts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of dictating \\'one belt, one road.\\'”15 \\nU.S. officials should also consider talking about the “Belt and Road Strategy,” rather than using Beijing’s \\nmore innocuous “Belt and Road Initiative.” It would be even more effective to coordinate these messages \\nwith partners, particularly members of the newly-revived Quad (Australia, India, and Japan). The Trump \\nadministration has also begun to articulate an alternative vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” that \\nprotects the independence and sovereignty of regional countries.16 U.S. foreign policy will have to do more \\nto reflect this commitment to a more liberal order. In addition, current efforts to enhance U.S. broadcasting \\nand information operations, largely in response to Russian disinformation campaigns, should also focus on \\ndeveloping more capable China-related and Chinese-language platforms to report on BRI activities in \\nrelevant countries.  \\n\\nCapacity-building for recipient countries: It bears underscoring that Belt and Road is not an inherently bad \\nthing, despite the discussion herein of potential security challenges. Clearly, there is demand for more \\ninfrastructure in Eurasia, and there is no viable alternative to replace entirely China’s potential provision of \\nresources. That being said, negative externalities will develop if recipient countries are subject to corruption \\nand coercion, or caught in debt traps that China exploits for political and strategic ends. At the low end of \\nthe spectrum, the United States should consider teaming up with like-minded countries (including Australia, \\nJapan, and Singapore) to provide technical assistance to help recipient countries evaluate proposed major \\ninfrastructure projects. Washington should also consider which existing multilateral institutions could act as \\na clearing house of best practices or a forum to assess BRI projects.

Chinese \\nsources suggest that Beijing is using BRI investments as a means of stabilizing border regions, \\nsecuring energy supply routes, and cultivating stronger diplomatic and economic influence with \\npartner nations. However, those goals could be constrained by challenges ranging from the \\nphysical risks of operating in remote and unstable areas to the possibility of unilateral and \\ncoordinated opposition from other major powers. These are in addition to the inherent economic \\nchallenges associated with infrastructure development (such as the ability of developing and \\npoorly governed states to repay debts).  \\n\\nAware of the risks, Beijing is marshalling all forms of national power to create a safer and more \\nstrategically advantageous context for the BRI. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is \\nimproving its ability to carry out non-traditional security operations such as non-combatant \\nevacuations and disaster relief missions at longer range and for longer periods. China is also \\ndeveloping other options, including host nation support, private security firms, and law \\nenforcement initiatives, to secure BRI personnel and assets. At the strategic level, Beijing is \\nusing high-level engagements, public diplomacy, and economic inducements to reduce the \\npotential for the BRI to aggravate competition with other major powers. \\n\\nChina’s success will depend in part on the reactions of other countries. From a U.S. perspective, \\nthe Trump administration will have to weigh competing factors as it designs a response: overt \\nconfrontation with Beijing may impose a cost on U.S. firms hoping to take advantage of new \\nopportunities and harm U.S.-China relations, while accommodation could fuel Chinese \\nambitions, jeopardize U.S. interests in prudent lending and market access, and alienate U.S. \\npartners such as Japan and India that have expressed serious concerns about China’s activities.  \\nThe Department of Defense will also have to consider tradeoffs as it decides whether, and how, \\nto collaborate with the PLA in ways that enhance security along BRI routes.

Mitigating threats across China’s restive western periphery is a\\nperennial challenge for Beijing. Key problems include Tibetan and Uighur separatist\\nmovements and their cross-border advocates, narcotics trafficking, infiltration of Islamic\\nextremists into western China via Central Asia, and even concerns about foreign-\\nsponsored “color revolutions” in border areas.8 Fostering infrastructure development and\\nregional economic connectivity, in the view of Chinese analysts, can help address the\\nroots of instability by lifting neighboring populations out of poverty, bolstering (often\\nauthoritarian and China-friendly) regimes, and tying Xinjiang more closely into the\\nregional economy. A related benefit, though not explicitly argued in Chinese sources, is\\nthat a safer western border region implies fewer strategic distractions and more resources\\navailable for China to expand its influence across maritime Asia.9\\n\\n• More Secure Energy Supply and Transport Routes. Another persistent dilemma has been\\ndiversifying China’s energy supplies, which remain heavily dependent on maritime\\ntransport routes through the Strait of Malacca and other chokepoints.10 Dubbed the\\n“Malacca Dilemma” during the Hu Jintao era, the concern is that China’s oil imports\\ncould be subject to interdiction by foreign navies during a crisis. BRI projects such as an\\noil pipeline linking Pakistan’s Gwadar Port with Xinjiang and a second Sino-Russian oil\\npipeline (which came online in January 201811) could help reduce, but not eliminate,\\nChina’s overreliance on vulnerable sea lanes. The BRI’s maritime component, known as\\nthe Maritime Silk Road, could also help secure China’s continuing maritime shipments\\nthrough additional port development, including the opening of new PLA navy overseas\\nlogistics bases.12\\n\\n• Stronger Chinese Economic and Diplomatic Influence. Drawing from a prominent 2012\\nGlobal Times editorial by Beijing University professor Wang Jisi, Chinese analysts\\nportray the unveiling of BRI projects as the realization of a “march west”—the premise\\nbeing that the absence of the United States as a strategic heavyweight in Eurasia has\\ncreated an opportunity for China to extend its diplomatic and economic influence in the\\n\\n8 See, e.g., “China’s Military Strategy,” State Council Information Office, May 26, 2015, \\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2015-05/26/c_134271001.htm.  \\n9 For a discussion of Chinese strategic aims along the Asian littoral, see Joel Wuthnow, “Asian Security without the \\nUnited States?

For instance, \\ndevelopment of China-Kazakhstan freight and passenger lines since 2013 support the \\nelevation of bilateral relations into a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” which also \\nincludes regular high-level diplomacy, counter-terrorism cooperation, and expansion in \\nbilateral trade.14  \\n\\nWhile articulating clearly defined, and ambitious, strategic objectives, Chinese assessments \\ngenerally avoid more sweeping proclamations about Beijing’s willingness or ability to create an \\nuncontested, Mackinder-esque sphere of influence in Eurasia. There are several reasons why \\nChinese self-assessed aims may remain limited, rather than expansive. BRI projects are funded \\nprimarily by loans that are meant to eventually be repaid. However, China is investing in \\ncountries that, in many cases, pose significant credit risk: a 2017 Moody’s analysis, for instance, \\nfound that 54% of BRI investments have gone to countries with poor (i.e. Ba1 or lower) \\ninvestment ratings.15 Christopher Johnson also suggests that the underlying political motives \\ndriving the BRI, including the need to buttress Xi Jinping’s political legacy, mean that the Party \\nleadership may “stay the course” on high-profile but financially unsound projects, resulting in a \\nbleaker long-run economic outlook.16 \\n\\nFrom a security perspective, Chinese analysts are also conscientious of the potential pitfalls. \\nRather than inflating the prospects for strategic gains, Chinese sources tend to focus more on the \\noperational and strategic-level vulnerabilities that Beijing will have to address in order to \\nsuccessfully implement BRI projects. Often debating amongst themselves, authors offer a variety \\nof proposals for how to mitigate those risks using both military and civilian means.   \\n\\nOperational Risks and Mitigation Strategies \\n\\nEven before the BRI was launched in late 2013, China had experienced the dangers involved in \\nconducting business operations in remote and unstable regions. Major incidents, such as 2006 \\nanti-China riots in Zambia and the 2011 Libyan civil war, which required the PLA to conduct an \\nimprovised evacuation of around 35,000 Chinese oil workers, grabbed domestic headlines and \\nplaced an impetus on Beijing to consider how Chinese personnel and assets could be protected.17 \\nThus Chinese officials have been under no illusions about the physical risks involved in building \\ninfrastructure and transportation networks across conflict prone areas of Central and South Asia, \\nand into the Middle East.

These include the March 2015 \\nevacuation of more than 500 Chinese nationals from Yemen, denoting not only risks to overseas \\nworkers, but also regional instability astride key maritime shipping lanes; the November 2015 \\nkilling of a Chinese citizen by ISIS radicals in Syria; the May 2017 abduction and murder of two \\nChinese citizens in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province (site of Gwadar Port and other key BRI \\nprojects);19 and a December 2017 Chinese embassy warning that terrorist attacks in Pakistan \\nmay be imminent.   \\n\\nChinese analysts anticipate that these types of problems will expand as BRI projects enter their \\nconstruction and operational phases. Key challenges include inter- and intrastate sectarian \\nviolence, which could destabilize host nations and place workers in danger; hostage-taking for \\nransom; terrorist attacks carried out by groups such as ISIS, Pakistani militants, or the Turkestan \\nIndependence Party (formerly known as the East Turkestan Independence Movement); and \\nmajor natural disasters such as earthquakes and mudslides, which may be increasing due to \\nclimate change effects.20 These problems are exacerbated by China’s limited capacity to address \\nthem. Chinese sources identify problems such as insufficient strategic air and sea lift (needed to \\ncarry out non-combatant evacuations), inadequate private personnel security services, and weak \\npolitical risk analysis capabilities.21 \\n\\nThese assessments have prompted consideration of the ways in which China needs to be \\nprepared to secure its overseas BRI interests. Analysts discuss the tradeoffs of different types of \\napproaches, which include the following:  \\n\\n• Stronger Expeditionary Capabilities. One remedy would be expanding expeditionary\\nPLA capabilities, such as more long-range naval deployments (and overseas logistics\\nbases), additional strategic air lift, and more rapidly deployable ground forces.22 Such\\nassets would be helpful in defending critical sea lanes, as well as in conducting non-\\ncombatant evacuation, disaster relief, and counter-terrorism operations.

Another approach is relying more extensively on host nation law\\nenforcement, intelligence, and military support. The most prominent example is a 12,000-\\nstrong force drawn from the Pakistani army that has protected Chinese workers in\\nGwadar and other sites along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor since 2015.24 PLA\\ninterviewees also describe the possibility of working with the Taliban, who they\\ncharacterized as a “friendly” organization, to protect Chinese copper mines in northeast\\nAfghanistan that have been dormant for years because of security concerns.25 Benefits of\\nthis approach could include cost effectiveness, delegation of risks to non-Chinese\\nnationals, and reliance on forces with intimate knowledge of local languages, customs,\\nand terrain. Key challenges, however, would include limited host nation capacity to\\nhandle major emergencies, reliability, and opposition of foreign publics to units being\\nallocated to protect Chinese workers and assets.\\n\\n• Private Security Services. A third approach is increasing reliance on foreign or Chinese\\npersonnel security companies, in addition to insurance and risk assessment services.\\nSome Chinese firms may contract with more expensive but experienced foreign security\\nproviders such as Academi (formerly known as Blackwater), while other may hire\\ncheaper domestic contractors. Chinese oil conglomerate Sinopec, for instance, has\\nretained Shanghai-based Dewei Security to provide self-defense training for overseas\\nworkers, and to engage local employees to provide personnel and site protection.26\\n\\nAlthough cost effective and potentially useful in addressing low-level risks, deficiencies\\nof relying on private Chinese security companies include limited regional expertise,\\ndomestic regulations prohibiting overseas ownership of firearms, and employment of\\nlocal contractors who may not be reliable.27\\n\\ninvestments.

A final option is to strengthen bilateral or multilateral security\\npartnerships to collectively address risks. Examples include combined training with\\nforeign partners in non-traditional security areas such as counter-piracy, counter-\\nterrorism, and disaster relief;28 maritime security cooperation, such as joint China-\\nASEAN patrols in the Mekong River basin; and intelligence sharing and law enforcement\\ncooperation, including a counter-terrorism mechanism established in 2016 between\\nChina, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.29 These activities provide several\\nadvantages, such as cost distribution, capacity building, and generating mutual trust and\\nregional awareness, but are generally not oriented towards crisis response and remain\\ncontingent on the commitment of resources from both China and partner governments.\\n\\nThe key source of debate between Chinese analysts is how much emphasis to place on building \\nthe PLA, whose Party-defined responsibilities include protection of China’s overseas interests, \\ninto a more global expeditionary force, versus outsourcing security to different arrangements \\n(host nation support, private security, or international cooperation).30 Although the mix of \\nstrategies remains in flux, extrapolating from current trends suggests that Beijing will rely on a \\nmulti-layered patchwork of different approaches, varying across regions and focused on different \\ntypes of threats, to reduce operational challenges facing the BRI.  \\n\\nStrategic Risks and Mitigation Strategies \\n\\nAt the strategic level, the BRI is not unfolding in a geopolitical vacuum: several other major \\npowers have concerns about how China’s activities will affect their interests. Despite a May \\n2015 Sino-Russian agreement to forge a “great Eurasian partnership,” for instance, some Russian \\nanalysts remain wary about China’s growing presence in Central Asia.31 Indian strategists worry \\nthat Chinese investments in the Indian Ocean region, such as port development projects in Sri \\nLanka and Pakistan, will precipitate a greater Chinese naval presence in India’s backyard.32 \\nIndian officials and major thinkers have also criticized the BRI as predatory and illiberal.33  The \\n2017 U.S. National Security Strategy, without naming the BRI, warns about Chinese attempts to \\n\\n28 For instance, the PLA navy conducted its first anti-piracy exercise with the U.S. navy in September 2012 and with \\nNATO in November 2015.

For instance, Major General Zhu Chenghu argues that China should rely less on the PLA and more on \\nprivate security companies.

One method is developing partnerships with foreign\\ncompanies. One Chinese report, for instance, argued that the BRI will provide U.S. firms\\nwith “great business opportunities in all sectors,” citing cooperation between General\\nElectric and the China National Machinery Industry Corporation in building Kenya’s\\nwind power infrastructure as a successful model (albeit not a BRI project per se).41 The\\npremise is that pressure from the business community will translate into political\\nsupport. Whether this approach will succeed in the U.S. context is unclear. Comments\\nduring the early months of the Trump administration highlighting potential U.S.\\neconomic cooperation in BRI projects has given way to a stronger emphasis, evident\\nduring the 2017 quadrilateral discussions in Manila, on prudent lending and cooperation\\nbetween Indo-Pacific democratic allies and partners.42\\n\\n34 The White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America, December 2017, 25.  \\n35 Thanks to NDU’s Thomas Lynch for data points in this area.  \\n36 Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “Partnership for Quality Infrastructure,” May 21, 2015, 1-2.  \\n37 “Asia Africa Growth Corridor: Partnership for Sustainable and Innovative Development,” Presentation at the \\nAfrican Development Bank Meeting, May 2017.  \\n38 The White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America, December 2017, 39.  \\n39 “Australia-India-Japan-U.S. Consultations on the Indo-Pacific,” U.S. State Department, November 12, 2017, \\nhttps://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/11/275464.htm.  \\n40 Wuthnow, Chinese Perspectives on the Belt and Road Initiative, 17-22. \\n41 Boarding the Fast Train: Case Studies and Practical Solutions for the U.S. to Connect to the Belt and Road \\nInitiative, Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University, September 2017, 3-10.  \\n42 Early comments include NSC Senior Director for Asia Matt Pottinger’s reported comments at the May 2017 Belt \\nand Road Forum suggesting that U.S. companies as “ready to participate in Belt and Road projects.” Stuart Lau, \\n“U.S. Warms Up to ‘Belt and Road’ Business Potential,” South China Morning Post, May 14, 2017, \\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2094295/us-warms-belt-and-road-business-potential.  \\n\\n85Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n• Leveraging bilateral relationships. China has also leveraged bilateral relationships to\\nencourage support for the BRI. For example, a November 2017 meeting between Xi and\\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in which the two leaders agreed to make a “fresh\\nstart” in Sino-Japanese relations, led in part to Tokyo offering financial incentives for\\nJapanese firms to build joint ventures with Chinese companies in areas related to\\ninfrastructure development (though perhaps intended more as a substitute than a\\ncomplement to the BRI framework).43 China has also solicited U.S. support for the BRI\\nin high-level meetings, though with less tangible results.44 Coercive diplomacy is also an\\noption. Some Indian observers, for instance, contend that China escalated tensions in the\\nDoklam border region during mid-2017 in order to signal dissatisfaction with Prime\\nMinister Narendra Modi’s absence from the Belt and Road Forum, and to push India into\\na more positive approach toward BRI.45\\n\\n• Shaping international public opinion. A third method is working through media, public\\ndiplomacy, and Track II channels to reduce suspicions about the BRI in major countries\\nand explore avenues of cooperation. Messages delivered by PLA interlocutors in recent\\ndiscussions, for instance, include casting U.S. officials’ criticisms of the BRI, such as\\nthose offered by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in October 2017,46 as unfair, affirming\\nthat China’s ultimate ambition is not to “replace the U.S. as world hegemon,” and\\nframing the BRI as a “constructive means” for both countries to improve relations and\\ncontribute to global public goods provision.47\\n\\nLargely absent from Chinese assessments is the acknowledgement that China’s own practices \\nmay be contributing to regional demand for alternative infrastructure funding. Secretary \\nTillerson argued that the nature of Chinese financing is burdening partners with “enormous \\nlevels of debt,” and resulting in projects that rely on “foreign workers,” rather than creating local \\njobs.48 In Djibouti, for instance, three China-backed projects have led the debt-to-GDP ratio to \\nballoon from 50% in 2014 to 85% in 2016, with the International Monetary Fund warning that \\nthe country remains at high risk of debt distress.49 This has prompted concerns about whether \\n\\n43 “Japan to Help Finance China’s Belt and Road Projects: Nikkei,” Reuters, December 5, 2017, \\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-china-beltandroad/japan-to-help-finance-chinas-belt-and-road-projects-\\nnikkei-idUSKBN1E003M.  \\n44 See, e.g., “U.S. President Donald Trump Meets With Yang Jiechi,” PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, June 23, \\n2017, http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1473199.shtml.  \\n45 Sushil Aaron, “Is China Punishing India For Its Belt and Road Stance While Testing Modi and Trump?” \\nHindustan Times, July 4, 2017, http://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/is-china-punishing-india-for-its-belt-and-\\nroad-stance-while-testing-modi-and-trump/story-1NIB0lcGtgMy4UVO5pDO1M.html.  \\n46 See Rex W.

One approach is \\nusing public diplomacy to counter narratives about China acting as a “neocolonial power,”51 but \\nthis message will not resonate if projects fail to create local jobs, worsen local corruption \\nproblems, or create environmental problems.52 Another choice would be debt forgiveness, but \\nthis would strain government coffers and underscore the poor decision-making that contributed \\nto non-performing BRI loans. China may also convert unpaid debt to equity shares in \\ninfrastructure projects, as in Sri Lanka’s December 2017 decision to grant China a 99-year lease \\nof the Hambantota port to repay part of its $8 Billion debt. However, this could raise local \\nconcerns to even higher levels as critical infrastructure is ceded to a foreign power.53 Thus, states \\nmay seek alternative financing—or forego projects altogether.54 \\n\\nConclusion and Policy Implications \\n\\nIn sum, the strategic aims driving the BRI—creating a safer neighborhood, securing energy \\nsupplies, and cultivating influence—are ambitious, though somewhat attenuated by perceived \\nrisks and challenges. Not only are BRI projects subject to the physical risks inherent in large-\\nscale infrastructure development across the Eurasian hinterland, which are exacerbated by \\nChina’s limited ability to address them, but the whole enterprise is also vulnerable to unilateral \\nor collective responses by China’s major competitors. Souring relations between China and \\npartner nations, due to the norms, premises, and stringent terms attached to BRI locations and \\nfinancing, may impose further limits on Beijing’s ability to convert economic cooperation into \\ngeopolitical gains.  \\n\\nChina’s success will depend in part on the reactions of other major countries. From a U.S. \\nperspective, policymakers will have to weigh multiple competing factors in designing a coherent \\nresponse. On one hand, overt confrontation with Beijing would be an irritant in U.S.-China \\nrelations and potentially cost U.S. firms the chance to take part in BRI projects (as illustrated by \\na recent agreement between General Electric and China’s Silk Road Fund in the energy \\ninvestment arena).55 On the other hand, accommodation could imperil U.S. stakes in prudent \\nlending and Eurasian market access, alienate U.S. partners such as Japan and India that have \\nexpressed serious concerns about China’s activities, and fuel China’s strategic aims beyond their \\ncurrent levels.

The Trump \\nadministration has offered some implicit critiques of the BRI,56 and suggested the need for \\nalternative infrastructure development approaches. Congress could ask U.S. officials to articulate \\na more detailed strategic approach for protecting U.S. values and interests, including specifying \\nthe resources needed to offer alternatives for the region. In addition, Congress’s research arms \\ncan sponsor independent analysis of U.S. interests and strategic options (e.g., ways in which the \\nUnited States can partner with Japan, India, and others to promote alternative economic corridors \\nand offer alternative financing).  \\n\\nA narrower question is whether and how the Department of Defense should cooperate with \\nChina in areas related to securing BRI routes. As part of Xi’s emphasis on improving U.S.-China \\nmilitary relations,57 the PLA has pursued increased operational and training cooperation with the \\nUnited States in areas such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, counter-piracy, and \\ncounter-terrorism.58 From a Chinese perspective, this engagement is not only useful in fostering \\nmutual trust, but may also help create a safer environment for China’s overseas interests. Some \\nof these activities have already been pursued, including U.S.-China combined counter-piracy \\nexercises in the Gulf of Aden, last held in December 2014, and China’s participation in the non-\\ntraditional security portions of the U.S.-led multinational RIMPAC exercise. \\n\\nHowever, bilateral military cooperation will need to be pursued in the context of U.S. strategic \\ngoals, policy judgments, and legal constraints. The 2000 National Defense Authorization Act, in \\nparticular, requires the Secretary of Defense to restrict engagements with the PLA in 12 areas \\nwhen contact would create a “national security risk due to an inappropriate exposure.” Counter-\\nterrorism cooperation, for instance, could expose the PLA to advanced warfighting tactics, \\ntechniques, and procedures, even if both countries share an interest in reducing terrorist threats.59 \\nThus caution in responding to Chinese entreaties is warranted, and sensible. At a minimum, the \\ngeographic combatant commands should remain in regular contact with their Chinese \\ncounterparts as PLA units enter their areas of responsibility, so as to better understand Chinese \\ngoals and capabilities, de-conflict activities, and identify areas where both sides may cooperate \\nto achieve shared goals.   \\n\\nU.S. officials should also anticipate that expansion of BRI projects will be accompanied by \\nenhanced Chinese military diplomacy throughout Eurasia. Over the past 15 years, China has \\nexpanded capacity-building, combined training, and high-level engagements with states such as \\nPakistan and Afghanistan; those efforts may continue both as part of a broader effort to \\n\\n56 These include the State Department’s readout of the U.S.-Japan-India-Australia quadrilateral dialogue, which \\nreferenced “increasing connectivity consistent with international law and standards, based on prudent financing,” \\nand the December 2017 National Security Strategy, which discussed modernization of development finance.  \\n57 For a discussion, see Phillip C.

And this type of hearing I think it crucial to informing the U.S. government \\nas it tries to formulate a response, very much hopefully in the larger context of how the U.S. \\ndeals with a rising China. \\n\\nI want to quickly give you some of the wave tops of my written testimony, and I \\nmay stray a little bit beyond seven minutes but I promise I won\\'t go on too long beyond that. \\n\\nFirst, again, context to emphasize.  China seeks to transform the rules-based \\ninternational order, and BRI is one element of that larger approach.  While my testimony is going \\nto focus on BRI, it is important to keep in mind the larger context, which is the need to formulate \\na U.S. response that is nested within a positive American strategy to reinforce the rules, norms, \\nrelationships, and institutions that have underpinned peace, prosperity, and democracy expansion \\nfor more than seven decades. \\n\\nTurning to the drivers beyond BRI.  As you most likely heard during the last \\npanel, they are primarily domestic economic relating to China.  But there are certainly \\ngeostrategic and military considerations.   \\n\\nAbove all, President Xi Jinping\\'s vision of national rejuvenation, a China that is \\npredominant in Asia and a leading power globally in 2049.  And then there are long-standing \\nconcerns about China\\'s energy dependence on potentially vulnerable sea lines of communication \\nand a desire to stand up new China-centric regional and international organizations. \\n\\nGiven BRI\\'s enormous ambitions, even if many projects never deliver or fall \\nthrough, it could still reshape the geostrategic and military landscape of the Indian Ocean Rim \\nand Eurasia in at least six ways. \\n\\nFirst, BRI will increase the demand for China to project military power abroad.  \\nAs Chinese investment and workers flow into far-flung and sometimes unstable regions of the \\nworld, the demand for the PLA to conduct noncombatant evacuations, humanitarian assistance \\nand disaster relief operations, and counterterrorism missions will grow. \\n\\nSo will the demand on the PLA Navy to protect the sea lines of communication.  \\nIn turn, BRI will reinforce the voices within the PLA calling for more investment in power \\nprojection capabilities although the preferences for what form this investment takes will likely \\ndiffer by service. \\n\\nSecond, BRI will enable China to more effectively project power overseas.  The \\ndual-use infrastructure that China constructs through BRI such as ports and airfields can serve as \\nbuilding blocks for a more robust logistics network that enables the PLA to deploy more \\nregularly and at a larger scale into the Indian Ocean and beyond. \\n\\nDjibouti is a case in point where China initially built a commercial port and \\nsubsequently secured agreement from the Djiboutian government for a nearby military facility.  \\n\\n9090\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n Third, BRI will enhance China\\'s diplomatic leverage.  In offering loans to \\ncountries at a level beyond their ability to repay, China has created debt traps that translate into \\nfinancial leverage and permanently unequal diplomatic relationships.  This gives China an \\nopening to parlay dual-use infrastructure constructed by its investment into future military \\nfacilities.  It could also enable China to compel indebted countries to support its larger agenda on \\nissues such as maritime disputes in the South China Sea or in international forums like the \\nUnited Nations. \\n Fourth, BRI will complicate U.S. military operations.  The expansion of the \\nPLA\\'s presence that BRI both accelerates and enables will pose new challenges for how the U.S. \\nmilitary operates.  In peacetime the United States and China will operate in close proximity, not \\nonly in new locations such as the Indian Ocean but also in new ways, such as conducting \\nmissions from bases in Djibouti that are less than ten miles apart. \\n To the extent that BRI paves the way for China to station its submarines in the \\nIndian Ocean, it will increase the undersea threat to U.S. warships operating there. \\n Lastly, China could ultimately seek to deploy destabilizing military capabilities \\nsuch as long-range anti-ship missiles in the bases or military facilities that BRI enables.  This \\nwould create on a small scale the type of anti-access and aerial-denial challenge that currently \\nconfronts the U.S. military in the Western Pacific. \\n Fifth, BRI will bolster China\\'s digital influence.  Digital infrastructure has \\nemerged as a major element of BRI and could pose a unique set of challenges as Chinese \\ncompanies have few qualms about exercising censorship, eroding online privacy or intercepting \\ntrade secrets at the behest of the government in Beijing. \\n China could potentially glean large amounts of data from the digital infrastructure \\nconstructed by BRI.  This data could fuel China\\'s AI industry and also give its companies a \\npotential edge in engaging consumers in markets across Eurasia and the Indian Ocean Rim. \\n Sixth, and finally, BRI will weaken European cohesion on China.  The European \\nUnion\\'s leadership has displayed a cautious approach toward BRI, but states in Central and \\nEastern Europe are eager for Chinese investment, creating frictions.  Chinese investment into \\nCentral and Eastern Europe, though not always large, has already translated into diplomatic \\nleverage. \\n And BRI will likely reduce Europe\\'s capacity to function as a unified actor, \\ncertainly a unified partner in any American response to address not only BRI but also China\\'s \\nlarger mercantilistic trade and investment practices. \\n I now want to turn to some guidelines for how the U.S. responds to BRI, \\nrecognizing that ultimately this must be in the larger context of a positive strategy for sustaining \\na rules-based international order. \\n There are at least six major elements.  The first is avoid a purely confrontational \\napproach.  The United States should learn the lessons of its failed opposition to China\\'s Asian \\nInfrastructure Investment Bank.  Countries need new sources of investment.  They will not reject \\nsomething for nothing. \\n Second, the U.S. must offer a positive vision, one that advances a vision of high-\\nquality physical and digital infrastructure, linking together Africa, Asia, the Middle East and \\nEurope in shared growth and preparation for the economy of the future. \\n This vision should include China.  The U.S. should also leverage its strengths \\nsuch as entrepreneurial models of growth that don\\'t saddle countries with debt and actually build \\ntheir local capacity over the long-term. \\n\\n9191\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n The third element is to place U.S. allies and partners at the center.  This, of \\ncourse, applies to a competitive American approach toward China more generally but certainly \\nwith respect to BRI.   \\n The United States alone cannot effectively respond to BRI given the Initiative\\'s \\nvast geographic scope and the resources that China has dedicated to it.  The United States should \\nseek to incorporate key allies and partners into the planning and execution of strategy toward \\nBRI, recognizing that this may make it more complicated. U.S. allies and partners certainly have \\ndifferent perspectives as I imagine you\\'ll hear in the next panel, but it\\'s essential for the long-\\nterm success of any American approach. \\n The fourth element is that the United States needs to try to shape Chinese \\noverseas basing.  In the context of BRI, the United States and its allies and partners should \\nidentify where a Chinese military presence would be most destabilizing and take action to \\nprevent it or at least mitigate the consequences. \\n It\\'s imperative to communicate to governments considering military access for the \\nPLA, what it might mean for their sovereignty, as well as some of the destructive military \\ncapabilities that Beijing might transfer and that could cause real challenges down the road. \\n The fifth element is to ensure the U.S. military can operate in anti-access and \\narea-denial environments.  Ultimately, a U.S. military designed to fight and prevail in the \\nWestern Pacific will be able to handle the comparatively modest anti-access and area-denial \\ncapabilities that China might deploy to future facilities overseas.  So that is important to keep in \\nmind. \\n And then, finally, six, the United States should focus on digital infrastructure.  \\nU.S. companies have a comparative advantage in the digital domain.  And the potential \\nimplications of the information technology dimension of BRI are the most uncertain and \\npotentially very consequential over the long term. \\n The United States and its allies and partners should consider launching a digital \\ndevelopment bank that would specialize in digital infrastructure across the Indian Ocean Rim \\nand Eurasia. \\n To conclude, now is the time to develop a strategic response to BRI in the larger \\ncontext of sustaining a rules-based international order.  In the absence of a coordinated approach \\nthat brings together the United States, its allies and partners, large parts of the Indian Ocean Rim \\nand Eurasia could ultimately become the core of a new China-centric order. \\n Thank you. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n9292\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF DANIEL KLIMAN \\nSENIOR FELLOW, ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY PROGRAM, CENTER FOR A NEW \\n\\nAMERICAN SECURITY \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n9393\\n\\n\\n\\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\nTestimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \\nCommission \\n\\nThe Geostrategic and Military Drivers and Implications of BRI \\n\\nDaniel Kliman, Senior Fellow, Asia-Pacific Security Program \\nCenter for a New American Security* \\n\\nCommissioner Shea, Commissioner Tobin, thank you for the opportunity to testify before this \\ndistinguished commission on “The Geostrategic and Military Drivers and Implications of \\nBRI.”1 \\n\\nI commend this commission for convening a daylong hearing on different aspects of China’s \\nBelt and Road Initiative, or BRI. My testimony will focus on the geostrategic and military \\ndrivers and implications of BRI, while also touching on the larger elements of an American \\nstrategy intended to shape BRI to align with international rules and norms, cooperate \\nselectively with China, and compete smartly where required. \\n\\nWhat is BRI, and Why Does It Matter\\n\\nChina is making a trillion-dollar play to shape the economic and geopolitical future of the \\nIndian Ocean rim and Eurasia. Unveiled by Chinese President Xi Jinping in the fall of 2013,2 \\n\\nwhat has since become known as the Belt and Road Initiative (though still sometimes \\nreferred to as “One Belt, One Road”) is a long-term effort by Beijing to link together parts \\nof Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe through building ports, rails, roads, pipelines, \\nand telecommunications networks, and other types of infrastructure. \\n\\nGeographically, BRI covers countries representing 65 percent of the world’s population and \\none-third of its economic output. China plans to spend a trillion dollars in support of the \\ninitiative, which at present encompasses two major parts: a “21st Century Maritime Silk \\nRoad” stretching from Southeast Asia across the Indian Ocean into the Mediterranean Sea; \\nand, a “Silk Road Economic Belt” extending across Eurasia with branches terminating in \\nPakistan, Europe, and potentially additional locations. 3 A “Digital New Silk Road” that \\n\\n* The views presented in this testimony are Daniel Kliman’s alone and do not represent those of CNAS or any other\\norganizations with which he holds an affiliation. He wishes to thank CNAS colleague Melodie Ha for conducting\\nresearch in support of this testimony. CNAS is partnering with the Sasakawa Peace Foundation (SPF) on a project\\nfocusing on how the United States and its allies and partners should respond to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\\nOther entities with a general interest in BRI, such as the U.S. Government, the Government of Japan, and various U.S.\\ncorporations, are supporters of CNAS.

Yet BRI also reflects \\nseveral geostrategic and military considerations. First and foremost is President Xi Jinping’s \\nvision of national rejuvenation –a China predominant in Asia and the leading power globally \\nby 2049.5 Longstanding concerns about China’s energy dependence on vulnerable sea lines \\nof communication as well as a desire to stand up new China-centric international \\norganizations also motivate BRI.6 \\n\\nDespite some recent high-profile setbacks to several BRI projects, 7 China at present retains \\nthe initiative. And the United States should neither underestimate China’s ability to implement \\nthe vision articulated for BRI nor downplay the appeal of BRI to countries in dire need of \\ninvestment in physical and digital infrastructure. In late 2013, a lack of imagination prevented \\nthe United States from anticipating the scope and consequences of Beijing’s land reclamation \\nin the South China Sea, delaying a timely and vigorous response. By comparison, BRI is \\nunfolding over a far larger land and maritime expanse, and could have more sweeping \\nconsequences for the United States. \\n\\nGeostrategic and Military Implications of BRI\\n\\nGiven BRI’s enormous ambitions, even if many projects never fully deliver or fall through, it \\ncould still reshape the economic and geopolitical landscape of the Indian Ocean rim and \\nEurasia. Key geostrategic and military implications include: \\n\\nAccelerating the Demand for Chinese Power Projection. BRI increases China’s need to \\nproject military power abroad. As Chinese investment and workers flow into far-flung and \\nsometimes unstable regions, the demand for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to conduct \\nnoncombatant evacuations, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR), counter-\\nterrorism missions, and other activities that Chinese strategists call “military operations \\nother than war” will grow.8 So will the demand on the PLA Navy (PLAN) to protect sea \\nlines of communication that connect the major nodes of the “21st Century Maritime Silk \\nRoad.”9 In turn, BRI will reinforce voices within the PLA calling for more investment in \\ncapabilities to project power abroad – though preferences for what form this investment \\ntakes will likely differ by service. 10 \\n\\nFacilitating the Supply of Chinese Power Projection. Expanding the PLA’s presence \\noverseas will require a dedicated logistics network that goes beyond “pit stops” at \\ncommercial ports. The dual-use infrastructure that China constructs through BRI – such as \\nports and airfields – can serve as the building blocks for a more robust logistics network that \\nenables the PLA to deploy more regularly and at a larger scale into the Indian Ocean and \\nbeyond.11 Djibouti is a case in point, where China initially built a new commercial port and \\n\\n95Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nsubsequently secured agreement from the Djiboutian government to construct a nearby \\nmilitary facility.12 \\n\\nEnhancing China’s Diplomatic Leverage. China’s lending practices associated with BRI \\nat times deviate from global standards. In offering loans to countries at a level beyond their \\nability to repay, China has created debt traps that translate into financial leverage and \\npermanently unequal diplomatic relationships. This in turn gives China an opening to parlay \\ndual-use infrastructure constructed by its BRI investments into future military facilities that \\ncould provide a basis for projecting power in ways that go well beyond conducting non-\\ncombatant evacuations and counter-piracy.13 It also could enable China to compel indebted \\ncountries to support its larger geopolitical objectives on issues such as maritime disputes in \\nthe South China Sea and in multilateral forums like the United Nations. \\n\\nComplicating U.S. Military Operations. The expansion of the PLA’s presence overseas \\nthat BRI both accelerates and enables will pose new challenges for the U.S. military. In \\npeacetime, the United States and China will operate in close proximity, not only in new \\nmaritime locations such as the Indian Ocean, but also in new ways, such as conducting \\nmissions from bases in Djibouti that are less than 10 miles apart, 14 increasing the possibility \\nof accidents in a space that the “Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime \\nEncounters” concluded by the U.S. Department of Defense and China’s Ministry of \\nNational Defense in 2014 likely does not cover.15 To the extent that BRI paves the way for \\nChina to station its submarines in the Indian Ocean region,16 it will increase the undersea \\nthreat to U.S. warships operating there. Lastly, China could ultimately seek to deploy \\ndestabilizing capabilities such as long-range anti-ship missiles to the bases or military access \\npoints that BRI facilitates. This would create on a small scale the type of anti-access and \\narea-denial (A2/AD) challenge confronting the United States in the Western Pacific, and \\nelevate the risk to U.S. naval assets in the event of conflict. \\n\\nImproving China’s Energy Security. Roughly 80 percent of China’s oil imports pass \\nthrough the Strait of Malacca.17 BRI presents China with an opportunity to improve its \\nenergy security over the long term through creating a web of pipelines and ports that bypass \\nthis potential maritime chokepoint. Key projects include the China-Pakistan Economic \\nCorridor (CPEC), which will allow China to transport Middle East oil from Gwadar to its \\nwestern provinces, as well as a trans-Burma oil pipeline.18 Coupled with a growing PLA \\npresence in the Indian Ocean, these new pipelines and ports will likely give Chinese leaders \\ngreater confidence in their ability to weather a maritime economic blockade in the event of a \\nconflict. \\n\\nBolstering China’s Digital Influence. International attention has primarily focused on \\nChina’s efforts to build roads, rails, and ports across the Indian Ocean rim and Eurasia, yet \\ndigital infrastructure has emerged as a major element of BRI. Beijing has begun including \\ncommunications connectivity in its investment plans. Digital infrastructural investment by \\nChina could pose a unique set of challenges, as Chinese companies have few qualms about \\nexercising censorship, eroding online privacy, or intercepting trade secrets at the behest of the \\ngovernment in Beijing.19 Moreover, in its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development \\nPlan, China has announced its intent to “accelerate the broad application of AI technologies in \\n\\n96Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\ncountries along the ‘One Belt, One Road.’”20 China could potentially glean large amounts of data \\nfrom the digital infrastructure constructed by BRI. This data could help to fuel China’s AI industry, \\nand also give its companies a potential edge engaging consumers in markets across the Indian Ocean \\nrim and Eurasia. \\n\\nAntagonizing India – and Irritating Pakistan. BRI has amplified longstanding Indian \\nconcerns about Chinese encirclement. India has objected in particular to CPEC, which runs \\nthrough Kashmir, territory that both it and Pakistan claim. For India, the development of \\nthe Gwadar port – a flagship project of CPEC – also raises the prospect of a Chinese \\nmilitary foothold along its western approaches. As Indian anxieties about BRI have \\nincreased, it has accelerated efforts to strengthen ties with the United States and Japan. \\nFrom a U.S. perspective, this development reinforces regional stability; viewed from Beijing, \\nit fuels fear of regional containment. While antagonizing India, BRI has also begun to create \\nirritations in the China-Pakistan relationship. China has brought its own workers and \\ncompanies into Pakistan, doing comparatively little to build local capacity. And China has at \\ntimes attempted to impose strict conditions on lending that would undermine Pakistani \\nsovereignty. 21 Over time, BRI could make China an increasing target for local antipathy in \\nPakistan, perhaps reducing the level of popular dislike directed toward the United States. \\n\\nWeakening European Cohesion. Chinese investment into Europe associated with BRI has \\nexacerbated existing divisions pitting Western European states and Brussels – the seat of the \\nEuropean Union (EU) – against the less wealthy countries of Central and Eastern Europe. \\nThe EU’s leadership has displayed a cautious approach toward BRI, underscoring that it \\nmust “adhere to a number of principles including market rules and international standards.”22 \\nHowever, states in Central and Eastern Europe have embraced BRI, and in Hungary’s case, may \\nhave ignored European public tender requirements when awarding China with a high-speed railway \\ncontract. Chinese investment into Central and Eastern Europe has also translated into diplomatic \\nleverage, rendering European unity on key questions like how to manage China’s investment in high-\\ntechnology industries more challenging. Overall, BRI will likely reduce Europe’s capacity to function \\nas a unified partner in any American response to address China’s mercantilist trade and investment \\npractices.23 \\n\\nThe United States and BRI\\n\\nThe United States has yet to develop a coherent strategy toward BRI. During President \\nObama’s tenure in the White House, BRI occupied a minor place in the hierarchy of issues \\nthat made up U.S. China policy. Other issues dominated the Obama administration’s focus \\non Beijing. On the cooperative side, addressing climate change, promoting global economic \\ndevelopment, and ensuring support for UN Security Council sanctions against Iran received \\npriority. On the competitive side, countering Beijing’s construction and subsequent \\nmilitarization of artificial island outposts in the South China Sea absorbed the attention of \\nsenior officials. Consequently, the Obama administration never formalized a view of BRI. \\nEven so, its commitment to strengthen regional connectivity – as manifested in multiple \\ninitiatives spanning Central, South, and Southeast Asia – and drive to boost U.S. investment \\nacross the Indo-Pacific functioned as a de facto response. \\n\\n97Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nAlthough the Trump administration has yet to unveil a systematic response to BRI, it is clear \\nthat over the coming years, BRI will occupy a comparatively prominent place in U.S. policy \\ntoward China on the competitive side of the relationship. Senior administration officials \\nincluding the Secretaries of State and Defense have publicly criticized BRI.24 President \\nTrump has yet to directly address BRI in public remarks. However, in his speech at the \\nAPEC CEO Summit in November 2017, he delivered a thinly-veiled critique, calling for \\nalternatives to “state-directed initiatives that come with many strings attached.”25 Without \\nreferencing BRI by name, the Trump administration’s new National Security Strategy \\nacknowledges a “geopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of world order \\ntaking place in the Indo-Pacific region,” calling out China’s role in using economic \\ninducements and infrastructure investments to pursue its geopolitical aspirations.26 \\n\\nThe Trump administration has started to sketch out limited elements of a U.S. approach \\ntoward BRI. At the APEC CEO Forum in November, President Trump announced that the \\nUnited States would reform its development finance institutions to create new incentives for \\nprivate sector investments. He has also urged international financial institutions (IFIs) to \\ndedicate greater resources to large-scale infrastructure projects. \\n\\nThus far, the most promising aspect of the Trump administration’s evolving response to \\nBRI is growing cooperation with allies and partners. During the president’s November trip \\nto Asia, his administration announced that the U.S. Overseas Private Investment \\nCorporation (OPIC) would join with Japanese partners “to offer high-quality United States-\\nJapan infrastructure investment alternatives in the Indo-Pacific region.”27 Moreover, BRI \\nappears to have been a topic of discussion in recent senior level meetings with India, as well \\nas the revived US-Japan-Australia-India four-way talks, also known as the Quad.28 Overall, \\nthe Trump administration appears inclined to develop a robust strategic response to BRI. \\nYet whether the Trump administration can fully execute a response to BRI is uncertain given \\nits budgetary priorities and predisposition against multilateral organizations. \\n\\nGuidelines for a U.S. Strategic Response\\n\\nUltimately, a U.S. response toward BRI must occur within the larger context of a positive \\nAmerican strategy to sustain the rules-based international order that since the end of World \\nWar II has underpinned global peace, prosperity, and democracy expansion. Recognizing this, \\nthe United States should seek to shape BRI to align with accepted international norms and \\nstandards; pursue opportunities for selective cooperation with China; and compete where \\nrequired. \\n\\nThe following guidelines provide a basis for developing a U.S. response to BRI: \\n\\nAvoid a purely oppositional approach. The United State should learn the lesson of its failed \\nopposition to China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB): countries need new \\nsources of investment, and are unlikely to be persuaded that they should reject additional \\nopportunities for economic development based on abstract arguments over international \\nprinciples. BRI fills a void left by traditional international financial institutions. Moreover, \\nBRI’s activities run the gamut from predatory lending to investments that would pass muster \\n\\n98Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nunder global norms. BRI is not a monolith, and treating it as such will make it more difficult \\nto impose necessary scrutiny on those investments that deserve careful review. \\n\\nOffer a positive vision – one that includes China. The United States should advance an \\naffirmative vision of high-quality physical and digital infrastructure linking together Asia, \\nAfrica, the Middle East, and Europe in shared growth and preparation for the economy of the \\nfuture. Washington should emphasize that development financing should expand \\nopportunities – not constrict national choices through unsustainable debt or degrade national \\nsovereignty through terms that ultimately compel countries to cede control of critical \\ninfrastructure. American officials should articulate that they welcome a more connected Indian \\nOcean rim and Eurasia in which China serves as one of multiple major nodes in a network of \\nphysical and digital infrastructure constructed not only by China, but also by a diverse set of \\nstates. \\n\\nPlace U.S. allies and partners at the center. The United States should seek to incorporate \\nkey allies and partners into the planning and execution of a strategy toward BRI. Their \\ninterests and concerns should inform and undergird a U.S. approach, not least because the \\nUnited States alone cannot effectively respond to BRI given its vast geographic and financial \\nscope. When identifying the most promising countries to involve in this effort, the United \\nStates should focus on allies and partners with sufficient resources and stature to chart their \\nown approach toward BRI regardless of Chinese economic inducements or coercion. Here, \\nJapan, India, Europe, Australia, and Saudi Arabia stand out. This collection of allies and \\npartners will naturally have different perspectives and equities when responding to BRI, and \\nthe United States should provide a platform to facilitate information exchange and an \\nalignment of approaches where possible. \\n\\nShape Chinese overseas basing. With BRI both accelerating and enabling the PLA’s \\noperations abroad, the United States and its allies and partners should identify where a \\nChinese military presence would be most destabilizing and take action to prevent it or at least \\nmitigate the consequences. For the United States, this will likely mean focusing more on BRI \\ninvestments along the Indian Ocean rim than those in Central Asian states. The United States \\nand its allies and partners should convey to countries considering granting China military \\naccess the potential consequences for their sovereignty, as well as types of PLA capabilities \\nthat would prove most disruptive. Congressional Delegations could play an important role in \\ncommunicating these concerns to political decision makers in states where China is pursuing \\nmilitary access. \\n\\nEnsure the U.S. military can operate in A2/AD environments. To the extent that BRI \\neventually paves the way for a network of overseas Chinese military facilities that feature some \\noffensive capabilities, the United States could in the future confront on a limited scale the type \\nof A2/AD challenge that today defines the Western Pacific. It is therefore essential that the \\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) continues to invest in new capabilities and develops new \\noperational concepts that will allow U.S. forces to effectively operate in A2/AD \\nenvironments. A U.S. military designed to fight and prevail in the Western Pacific will be able \\nto handle the comparatively modest A2/AD capabilities that China might deploy to future \\nfacilities in the Indian Ocean. Congress can play an important role in ensuring that the DoD \\n\\n99Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nmaintains an adequate focus on the force modernization required to prepare the U.S. military \\nto operate in a highly contested environment. \\n\\nFocus on digital infrastructure. U.S. companies have a comparative advantage in the digital \\ndomain, and the potential implications of the information technology dimension of BRI are \\nmost uncertain – and potentially most consequential over the long term. The United States \\nand its allies and partners should consider launching a Digital Development Bank that would \\nspecialize in digital infrastructure and ensure that countries in the Indian Ocean rim and \\nEurasia have alternatives to a Faustian digital financing bargain with China. \\n\\nIn recent years, ambitious Chinese initiatives have too often caught the United States \\nflatfooted. Now is the time to develop a strategic response to BRI. In the absence of a \\ncoordinated approach that brings together the United States and its allies and partners, large \\nparts of the Indian Ocean rim and Eurasia could become the core of a new China-centric \\norder in which many states have little choice but to follow Beijing’s lead. \\n\\n1 This testimony draws on Daniel Kliman and Harry Krejsa, “Responding to China’s Belt and Road Initiative,” CNAS \\nCommentary, November 13, 2017, https://www.cnas.org/press/press-note/cnas-commentary-responding-to-chinas-\\nbelt-and-road-initiative; and Daniel Kliman and Manpreet S.

Chairman Cleveland. \\nCHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  I have a question for each of you.  Mr. Ratner, you \\n\\ndescribed the term burden-shifting, which I think is interesting, and you said that you thought \\nthat we should unilaterally--you may have used the word \"force,\"--compel, urge, encourage \\nChina to assume the burden of security responsibilities.  Can you describe where you mean that \\nbecause it\\'s kind of a departure from what I would think of in terms of where I\\'d want China \\npositioned? \\n\\nAnd then the second issue--I\\'ll turn to the second issue after you respond to that. \\nDR. RATNER:  Well, I guess a generic point and a specific point.  The generic \\n\\npoint is we should take a hard look at looking where we feel like as it relates to security and \\nstabilization, we are overextended.  Look at where China\\'s interests are emergent and \\nintensifying and where we think that their perception or conception of what they would want is at \\nleast with the bounds of something that we wouldn\\'t consider a major national security threat \\nanyway. \\n\\nSo if one were to draw that, I think the first place I would look would be \\nAfghanistan.  I think the fact that the United States is spending billions of dollars to build up the \\nAfghanistan military and secure that country when it is surrounded by a whole region that has \\nvital security interests there, and we are bearing the diplomatic and military and human costs of \\nthat alongside the Afghan people is quite extraordinary. \\n\\nAnd I think Beijing has shown that it has more interests there.  There were reports \\nin the last several weeks that they were setting up--it\\'s unclear exactly--but something along the \\nlines of some facilities in eastern Afghanistan, and I think the United States should think \\nseriously about talking to but also telling partners in the region, including working through the \\nShanghai Cooperation Organization, but directly to Beijing, that there are parts of Afghanistan \\nthat they will be responsible for stabilizing at Year X.  \\n\\nWhether it\\'s one year or two years or three years from now, I would defer to the \\nmilitary commanders about how much time it would take to appropriately withdraw U.S. forces, \\nbut I think that\\'s the kind of mentality we need to be in rather than sinking again tens of billions \\nof dollars into Afghanistan while China literally works around it to undermine the liberal order \\nand impose their own interests. \\n\\nCHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  You do remember when we suggested this \\npreviously, and their interest was in protecting a, I think it was a copper mine. It was some \\ninvestment that they had, and that was the limit of their interest in this issue.  So I think it\\'s an \\ninteresting--it presents an interesting question in the moment. \\n\\nDr. Kliman, would you describe a little more--I like the term \"debt trap,\" and as \\nyou may have heard this morning, I\\'m very interested in sort of the terms of loans that are being \\nextended by the various Chinese policy banks, and how there is a presumption, I think, baked in \\nof risk because they see that this isn\\'t just a financing mechanism.  It\\'s an opportunity to secure \\nassets in the event that the loan doesn\\'t pay off exactly the way they envision. \\n\\nSo if you could describe some of the--perhaps some examples of where you see \\nthis risk of a debt trap and what the implications are? \\n\\nDR. KLIMAN:  Absolutely.  I want to, before answering that, take a step back, \\n\\n102102\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nand I think it\\'s important to keep in context the criteria by which some of these investments were \\nmade, and they\\'re not necessarily pure kind of return on investment, but there also are certainly \\ngeopolitical considerations. \\n So even if China doesn\\'t make significant returns on investment, it gives it long-\\nterm leverage over a country, particularly one with some strategic geography, that may be a net \\nwin.  \\n To give you a few very concrete examples. One that is often raised, of course, is \\nSri Lanka where over time China rapidly built up certainly Sri Lanka\\'s share of debt that was \\nowed to Beijing and was ultimately able to essentially parlay the Hambantota port in the \\nsouthern part of Sri Lanka into a 99-year lease.  India ultimately was able to come and take a \\nkind of nearby airport and make a financial bid so China did not get both the airport and the port.  \\nBut that\\'s kind of one key example. \\n Djibouti is another where you saw rapid increase in Chinese debt over time.  \\nChina, of course, built the commercial port and then was able to build a military facility as well.  \\nSo two countries, again, where you\\'ve seen significant debt and then, at least in one, there has \\nalready been a military facility opened in Sri Lanka.  Obviously we\\'ll see where that goes. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Can I pause you on this?  Do you think--I mean \\nBurma and Kyaukpyu comes to mind in terms of the trade for the dam if that was what actually \\ntranspired.  Do you think that there is a conversation about we\\'re going to put this money on the \\ntable to build this facility, and if it works, it works, if it doesn\\'t, it doesn\\'t because we can then \\nleverage it?  I mean do you think this is a calculated kind of commercial, political, security \\ndecision, or do you think it\\'s accidental? \\n DR. KLIMAN:  I would think it\\'s--I don\\'t know on a case-by-case basis.  I would \\nimagine some of this is simply incentivized for Chinese firms to go out and make these \\ninvestments and call it Belt and Road.  \\n I think there certainly is a logic behind it that although these may not always pay \\noff commercially, there may be a geopolitical payoff.  I personally don\\'t have the insight into \\nkind of the decision-making that happens in these particular investments if there is a sort of let\\'s \\nknow that there\\'s not going to be any commercial payoff, but we\\'ll get something geopolitical in \\nreturn. \\n I would say it\\'s probably not seen as a negative for leadership in Beijing, but \\nwhether there\\'s kind of a calculus that\\'s very deliberate, I wouldn\\'t know. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Okay.  Thank you.  I\\'ll follow up. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay.  Thank you both.   \\n I have two questions which hopefully both of you could take a shot at answering \\nif you like. The first question deals with something you touched on in your testimony, Dr. \\nRatner: Russian-Chinese competition in Central Asia.  And many of these countries obviously \\nwere former Soviet republics and are in many respects culturally Russian.  \\n So my very high-level simplistic sense is that the Russians have ceded the \\neconomics to China in the Central Asian republics but have not ceded the security sphere, and \\nthe Chinese are careful about not offending Russian sensibilities on the security side.  So I\\'d like \\nyou to react to that.   \\n And the second question is something that you said, Dr. Kliman, that triggered a \\nthought, the Malacca Dilemma.  We hear that a lot of the BRI initiatives are the pipelines from \\nRussia, from Burma, from Central Asia are designed to solve or mitigate the Malacca Dilemma.   \\n But my sense is that they need so much oil, they need so much natural gas, that \\n\\n103103\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthe Malacca Dilemma will never be resolved through overland pipelines from Russia, Burma, \\nCentral Asia.  I\\'d like you to, I\\'d like you to comment on that. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Happy to go first on that.  So in terms of will BRI mitigate the \\nMalacca Dilemma, I would generally agree, I think at best partially, just given the sheer volume \\nof oil, and, yes, China can build ports and pipelines and overland routes in places like Burma or \\nPakistan. \\n My view would be that it at least provides--it would, it makes any kind of U.S. \\nmilitary operations potentially more challenging where there are more areas that would require \\nfocus in terms of the maritime domain, and so it does, in that sense, complicate a little bit, but it\\'s \\nnot going to necessarily kind of wean China off kind of the Malacca Strait.  \\n Probably at the end of the day, China\\'s best bet is the kind of clean energy \\ninvestments they\\'re making now, which over the long-term are designed to make their economy \\nless reliant on oil writ large, whether it\\'s imported from sort of ports in Burma or through the \\nMalacca Strait. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Thank you.   \\n Dr. Ratner. \\n DR. RATNER:  Yeah, I would generally agree with that point.  I think the \\ndiversification of China\\'s energy sources have been long underway prior to BRI, and it has an \\neconomic logic to it and otherwise.  I think they\\'re looking to alleviate sources of vulnerability, \\nand this won\\'t resolve, but it is part of that. \\n But it also goes to the earlier point that I made that what, again, from a purely \\nmilitary perspective what matters or not is if the United States can menace the People\\'s \\nLiberation Army in East Asia and in the South China Sea, and whether the closing of the \\nMalacca Straits affects their energy security may matter on the margins in a long-term military \\nconflict, but what we are at risk of here and what the United States government should be \\nfocused on is preventing China from pushing out a sphere of influence and effective control over \\ncertainly the South China Sea, if not other parts of their eastern littoral. \\n So I think that\\'s the real challenge, and again if you believe what Secretary Mattis \\nsaid last Friday, that military advantage is eroding, and that will be much more--whether the \\nUnited States can and is willing to fight will ultimately be what matters here and not whether \\nChina is going to be willing to pull or able to pull energy through the Malacca Strait.  But I think \\nit is part of an overall vulnerability mitigation strategy. \\n As it relates to the Russia question, this is a good example of where the BRI piece \\nof this is part of a much larger question about how does the United States think about its strategic \\ncompetition with China and where does Russia play into that, and how do we think about \\nmitigating the potential for Russian-Chinese collusion, which exists already, which I think will \\nonly happen if we force those two together because they do have shared interest, but they\\'re not \\nnatural allies. \\n And I think this is a reason why again just thinking practically about \\nrecommendations, to the extent that the United States can shed light on the types of activities that \\nare actually involved in BRI, I think that can be a useful way to ensure that the Russians are on \\nthe right side of this and in an area where I think the U.S. government would be, which would be \\nnot wanting to see undue Chinese influence rather than seeing Chinese partnership in this. \\n So I think shining a light and the transparency is really important, not only for the \\nrecipient countries but for some of these strategic dynamics as well. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay.  Thank you. \\n\\n104104\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n Dr. Tobin. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, gentlemen. \\n I\\'m going to approach my questions--I have three for you, Dr. Ratner, and I think \\non a second round, I have several specific for you, Dr. Kliman, and I\\'m sure we\\'ll have enough \\ntime this morning. \\n So, Dr. Ratner, your recommendations for U.S. policy were, I felt, outstanding, \\nand I want to give you an opportunity to orally tell us a little bit more about three of them, \\nplease. \\n You just mentioned the one about rebuild institutions for U.S. information \\noperations so that we can lay out the facts and the fictions of the Belt and Road Initiative to make \\npeople who are receiving some of these potential--what would you say--opportunities from \\nChina better understand what\\'s going on. \\n So I\\'d like you to just spin that out a little bit more.  Tell us how it would work, \\nwhat the United States could do, could one, two, three be set up?  Who would run it?  That\\'s the \\nfirst piece. \\n The second piece is shortly after that you mentioned capacity-building for \\nrecipient countries, and there you talked about establishing something that could be quite \\nstraightforward, a clearinghouse of best practices or a forum to assess BRI projects.  If you could \\ntalk about that. \\n And lastly, TPP.  As you know, both sides of the aisle have in the last political \\nyears have pulled away from that.  How would you urge the United States players to consider \\nrejoining or reshaping or will it make sense at all? \\n Thank you. \\n DR. RATNER:  Great.  Thank you. \\n Those are all terrific questions.  On the question of U.S. information operations, \\nto be concrete, the Broadcasting Board of Governors has started a 24/7 cable news Russian \\nchannel that has a very significant social media platform as well.  As I understand it, during the \\nIran protests, Voice of America and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, some of their \\nplatforms were some of the most viewed in the world, including in Iran and in China. \\n So they are, in my view, having seen a presentation on this recently, I was, I \\nshouldn\\'t say surprised, but happy to see how sophisticated they were in terms of the people who \\nwere in charge there.  They\\'re real communication specialists.  They\\'re thinking hard about how \\nto use data and who their audiences are, and this has been--this effort is focused at broadly \\naddressing the issue of Russian information operations and misinformation operations around the \\nworld. \\n Obviously we have that problem here in the United States.  That\\'s not their writ.  \\nBut they have been, I think by their account, quite effective in the information space as it relates \\nto Russia, and we ought to be doing the same as it relates to China because China has an even \\nmore sophisticated, I think, and even more comprehensive set of information operations and \\nsystems around the world, and again the story of that, those information operations, is China\\'s \\nascendant, China is the future, America is a mess, and the United States is in decline, and so you \\nbetter get on our side or you\\'re going to pay for it. \\n And I think the reality is obviously much more complicated than that, and my \\nunderstanding is the White House is in discussions with the Broadcasting Board of Governors to \\nthink about what is a China element to this, and you all ought to do what you can to support that. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  So would it be expanding their current charter \\n\\n105105\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nor is it within their charter as far as you know? \\n DR. RATNER:  It\\'s within their charter.  It would be more resources dedicated to \\nI think areas of, areas where we have concern about illiberal Chinese influence, and the goal \\nwould be to provide objective news, either in local language or in Chinese language as well.  So I \\nthink that\\'s something we could do. \\n Along with that, I would argue that the public affairs and public diplomacy parts \\nof our bureaucracy have atrophied certainly since the end of the Cold War.  But we have very \\ncapable people working in the public affairs bureaus and the Under Secretary for Public \\nDiplomacy at the State Department, but I think if you were to go and look at their activities, it\\'s a \\nlot of soft people-to-people social programs that aren\\'t integrated with strategic communications \\nis how we would think about it.  \\n And so it would be useful for--I think this would have to be a White House-led \\neffort, but to the extent that we use the term \"strategic communications\" within the White House, \\nit\\'s not just about what the President is going out and saying.  It\\'s about coordinating strategic \\nmessaging that\\'s professional and driven by people who understand these things, not necessarily \\nsomeone who has just come from their latest job at an embassy doing political work, but a real \\ncommunication specialist coordinating messages, getting them to the right people, and using our \\npublic affairs offices at the Pentagon and the State Department to their full effect. \\n So I think there\\'s a lot of work to be done there.  I think frankly the administration \\nis aware of this, and they\\'re focused on it, but it will take more resources and it will take better \\ninteragency coordination than we\\'ve seen to date.  So that\\'s on that point. \\n On the second, the issue of capacity-building for recipient countries, I think, I \\nguess one area where I would take a slightly different approach than Dr. Kliman in terms of his \\nassessment of the AIIB.  I wasn\\'t in government at the time so I\\'m not saying this to defend what \\nthe Obama administration did.   \\n But you could argue that was a diplomatic failure because the United States was \\nleft on the outside looking in, had a lot of egg on its face as its partners flocked to the AIIB. \\n On the other hand, the types of issues that say the liberal industrialized countries \\nwere urging China to take on, they largely did.  They diluted their shares due to international \\npressure. Their projects, that actually the influence of the bank and the number of projects \\nthey\\'ve done have moved more slowly than I think they would like because they\\'re adhering to \\nhigher standards that others imposed upon them. \\n So I think that\\'s an important lesson insofar as Beijing\\'s efforts can be shaped in \\nthis regard with sufficient international coordination and international pressure.  So there\\'s a case \\nmaybe Washington and the administration didn\\'t handle it as well as they could have, but the end \\nresult was largely where we were hoping. \\n And I think the same could be done with BRI if organizations like the G7 I think \\nwould be a place to have these conversations.  Some of the larger ASEAN organizations, the \\nEast Asia Summit potentially, certainly within the U.S.-ASEAN summits that we hold annually, \\nas well as the Quad, the newly revised Quad mechanism between the United States, Japan, \\nAustralia and India.   \\nI think all of these are places where groups can get together, get the experts together, and have a \\nset of, again, as I described it and as you described it, best practices or a place where human \\ncapital can be provided from--to look at some of these deals. \\n I will say part of the problem, of course, is that some of these recipient countries \\nfor their own political and economic reasons will want to go ahead with these projects whether \\n\\n106106\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthey\\'re economically viable or not. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n DR. RATNER:  So this isn\\'t a fail-proof solution and it\\'s not as if the recipient \\ncountries are the saints and the Chinese are always the antagonists here.  So I think that\\'s-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  But it is a voice. \\n DR. RATNER:  It\\'s not 100 percent solution. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n DR. RATNER:  But, again, it\\'s important. \\n As relates to the TPP question, it\\'s very hard, you know.  It will, I think it will \\nhonestly take strong leadership from American politicians to make the case that, number one, \\nagain, we are in a consequential strategic competition with China that it will down the road affect \\nthe wealth and security and prosperity and freedom of the American people and their children \\nand their grandchildren in subsequent generations if we don\\'t get serious here. \\n And that that is the lens through which we should look at the Trans-Pacific \\nPartnership, and if there are negative externalities as it relates to opening our markets, there are \\nways that we can deal with that through domestic policies, and there are people looking at that, \\nand free trade, I think it has been assessed certainly from now going forward is not the answer \\nhere.  And, in fact, setting higher standards is standing up for the American people, and, frankly, \\nas a Democrat, quite disappointing to see Democrats make a progressive--I know this isn\\'t a \\npartisan commission--but to see Democrats making an argument against what was largely a \\nprogressive deal that would have raised standards for women and children and the environment \\nhigher than 50 years of American diplomacy will do on its own waving its hand and through the \\nUSAID. \\n So I think there is a case to be made.  It will take political leadership, and it will \\ntake a larger sense of the meaningfulness of the strategic competition with China. \\n Just the last thing I\\'ll say on this is that obviously the Trump administration has \\nelevated the issue of China\\'s unfair trade practices to the front burner, and I think we\\'ve already \\nseen the solar panels case decided upon.  Steel and aluminum are coming down the pike.  And \\nthe then the 301 case as it relates to intellectual property and other unfair practices I think will be \\ncoming next. \\n We can play defense all we want.  The way you solve those problems is by \\nworking with your partners to set standards around some of those issues, and that\\'s what TPP \\nwas.  So I think there is enough strategic logic and economic logic and otherwise that if the \\ndomestic politics can be alleviated through other programs that TPP still makes all the sense in \\nthe world. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you very much. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Commissioner Stivers. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Thank you.  Thank you both for being here today \\nand for your excellent remarks. \\n You both mentioned the need for--the tremendous need for a positive and you \\nsaid comprehensive and competitive China strategy.  I would modify that a little bit to make sure \\nit\\'s an Asia strategy.  I think it\\'s important.   \\n And the policy options I think moving forward have to be both in the diplomatic \\nand development components.  I think we have a twofold challenge, and you both have worked \\nin the administration, and I think you can shed some good insight on this.  How do we bring this \\nU.S. government together?  You know, diplomacy and international development are two totally \\n\\n107107\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\ndifferent disciplines, you know. \\n Diplomacy is focused on building stronger and positive relationships.  \\nDevelopment is focused on saving lives and lifting people out of poverty and creating kind of the \\nunderlying prosperity and stability that we think is not only in the U.S. interests, but it\\'s in \\neveryone\\'s interests. \\n But there\\'s a real lack of overlap in those two worlds.  Development, there\\'s 15 \\ngovernment agencies that do development--more than that, I think.  Most of them don\\'t work in \\nChina.  They don\\'t--shouldn\\'t work in China.  They don\\'t work in China, and they don\\'t have \\nChina expertise in them. \\n And then you have a lot of the folks that, you know, they\\'re experts on China that \\nfocus I think more on the security and trade realms.  And so you really have this disconnect \\nbetween two worlds where I think a lot of the solutions or the policy options to compete with \\nChina are actually in the development world, but I don\\'t think those folks are thinking \\nstrategically about China.  They\\'re trying to save people\\'s lives as they should be because that\\'s \\ntheir job. \\n So how, you know, how does the administration bring these worlds together, and \\nthen what\\'s the role of Congress for that?  I mean should there be a bill that, you know, that can \\ncreate the strategy or mandate that the administration put this strategy together with these \\ncomponents? \\n Does there need to be something like a competing-with-China-influence fund \\nwhere we provide the resources to countries in Asia to--on civil society, on these sorts of things \\nthat can push back on some of these things?  So that\\'s my first question. \\n My second question--I\\'ll just throw this out there--is on the diplomacy side.  You \\nalso can bring your allies and partners together on this, too, and, you know, should there be an \\neconomic component of the Quad?  And how receptive are the countries of the Quad going to be \\nto that, especially if it\\'s seen as something that counters China?  And do you think, have you seen \\nin your work that they\\'re moving in this direction or that\\'s been on the table in the Quad \\ndiscussions? \\n Who wants to start? \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Great.  I\\'m happy to take at least some of that on.  All really great \\nquestions.   In terms of bridging the divide between diplomacy and development, I would say \\nmy hope--we\\'ll see if it plays out--is that the kind of elevation of long-term competition with \\nChina in this new national security strategy will trickle down.  It\\'s obviously incumbent on \\npeople at the White House to ensure that people, you know, all the different bureaucracies are \\nsocialized into that.  \\n But that ultimately I think having a fairly clear guidance from the top on this is \\nkind of U.S. strategy, we are competing with China, you should think of your activities in that \\ncontext and not in a simply let\\'s do good for the world although that\\'s important.  I think that will \\nbe at least useful. \\n One other piece is trying to encourage, and maybe there\\'s a role for Congress in \\nthis, but trying to encourage more China expertise to go into places like USAID.  It\\'s often very \\nhard to get people with China expertise into national security bureaucracies.  They shockingly \\nspend time in China often or have family backgrounds, and so it may be easier in some ways to \\nopen up the development space to folks who want to serve, and it may be hard for them to go \\ninto the kind of national security side of the government. \\n So I think there may be opportunities there to creatively bring more talent in, and \\n\\n108108\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nif you can essentially be kind of building on the sort of supply side more China expertise in \\ndevelopment, and then have the demand signal from the White House in national security \\nstrategy to help people understand that there is a competition, that may be positive.  \\n Also, even in terms of budgets, I think right now everybody is trying to justify \\ntheir budget, especially if you are in the development space.  And so there may be a national \\ntendency to grab onto competition with China, and so that may be a sort of positive externality of \\nsome of the what I would say are unfortunate proposed cuts.  But it may drive people in that \\ndirection on the development side. \\n In terms of the role of Congress, it was a really interesting question you had about \\nhave a compete-with-China fund.  You certainly could wonder whether there would be a way to \\ncreate sort of a pool of funding across the U.S. government where ideas for competition, whether \\nit was in the sort of information space or other kinds of creative opportunities, could almost like \\npitch each year ideas, and then that would be funded. \\n I think that would be helpful.  Often there\\'s a lot of ideas, but there\\'s not sort of a \\nbody of funding that moves quickly, and so having sort of surge grants or surge funding could be \\nvery useful, especially trying to empower people on the front lines of U.S. foreign policy who \\nwill see opportunities but often there\\'s no way for them to move funds around quickly enough to \\nperhaps seize on the opportunities that present themselves. \\n In terms of the kind of economic cooperation with the Quad, I\\'ll admit I\\'m a little \\nbit skeptical in part knowing sort of several members of the Quad.  U.S. bilateral economic \\ncooperation with India, obviously there\\'s a lot of long-term potential.  It\\'s an uphill slog.  We still \\ndon\\'t have a bilateral investment treaty.  \\n It seems hard to imagine kind of with the configuration of those four you\\'re going \\nto get a lot certainly sort of more trade liberalization among the four.  I think perhaps the more \\nopportunity for the Quad if you look beyond sort of the hard security might be in more capacity \\nbuilding, even kind of development.  Somebody is looking at how do you export models of \\nentrepreneurial development and technology assistance.  I mean to me that\\'s much more feasible \\nthan perhaps sort of enhancing trade liberalization among those four. \\n DR. RATNER:  I\\'ll just take a quick, just a quick intervention, to say 100 percent \\nagree on the Asia strategy.  That\\'s absolutely right.  China strategy is Asia strategy, and often we \\nget it the other way around to our own detriment.  And, yes, comprehensive means diplomatic \\nand economic and development, and I think the point I was trying to make earlier, we have to be \\nfiring on all cylinders to get this right, that if we think of the security challenges of BRI in a \\nnarrow military lane, we\\'re not going to have the influence that we need and the resources and \\npower to bend the curve on this. \\n The only other thing I would say in addition to what Dan said is I think there\\'s a \\nrelationship between the diplomacy and the development.  I think the other, perhaps the most, the \\nmore fruitful area, at least in the short term, is thinking about getting more China watching and \\nmore China expertise out of just the East Asia bureaus because we have things happening like \\nwhen the Chinese flipped Panama on their diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and all of a sudden \\nit\\'s, well, who was--do we have a China watcher in our embassy in Panama City, and the answer \\nis no. \\n And I think--and I know this is something that the last administration and the, \\nparticularly the policy planning they were thinking about, and they may have made some \\nheadway on, but we ought to have China experts in the places where these projects are \\nhappening, looking very closely and understanding what\\'s going on.  Because otherwise a lot of \\n\\n109109\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthis is going to happen, and it\\'s going to be too late before we realize what\\'s going on. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Thank you. \\n Senator Talent. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  I had a little trouble coming up with questions \\nbecause there isn\\'t a single thing either one of you said that I disagreed with.  I just thought it was \\nbrilliant except I share a little bit of the skepticism about the risk-sharing piece, what you said, \\nDr. Ratner. \\n So I\\'m going to take this down a little bit different direction.  It is very frustrating \\nthat there are so many things we could be doing that are well within our capabilities to do and \\nwe\\'re not doing them.  You mentioned the South China Sea, Dr. Ratner.  That to me is the \\nnecessary but not sufficient condition of any successful policy.  If we get pushed out of that area, \\nit doesn\\'t matter what else we do. \\n And I think one of the problems here--so now I put on my old hat, and I say to \\nmyself, you know, the difficulty with this is going back to Monett, Missouri or the Bootheel or \\nColumbia or the south side of St. Louis city, and explain to people why it matters to them in \\nterms that make a difference to them? \\n So you all have talked about the norm-based international order, and I completely \\nget it and completely support it.  But what would this mean to my former constituents in a real \\nsense?  If China succeeds in the national competition, overturns the norm-based international \\norder, at least in Asia, what difference does it make?  What could I say to them in terms of what \\ndoes it mean for your pocketbook, your family\\'s security? \\n And I know you can\\'t be exact about this, but some reasonable speculation good \\nenough for political purposes.  You know, so what, how does it matter to them?  Because I think \\nif the people who normally sit around this dais can explain that, then we can get the kind of \\ncommitment that we need. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yes.  Good point. \\n DR. RATNER:  Do you want to start? \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Sure.  We\\'ll see if we can give you something to distribute, \\nSenator. \\n [Laughter.] \\n DR. KLIMAN:  If you look at, I mean it\\'s interesting, if you look at the kind of \\ndawn of the Cold War, there was a very deliberate effort by the Truman administration to sort of \\nvery much simplify and distill the Soviet threat in terms everyone could understand, sometimes \\nperhaps even exaggerate aspects.  So I don\\'t think we want to go in that direction. \\n But in terms of how we could kind of distill it for the American people, in some \\nways I think we\\'re at potentially the right time where we\\'ve loosely touched on some of the \\nChina kind of trade and investment challenges that this administration is beginning to take action \\non, and to me that speaks very much more kind of to people\\'s pocketbook, and it\\'s that do you \\nwant to live in a world where China doesn\\'t play by the rules and your livelihood and those of \\nyour children are less versus a world in which all countries, including the U.S., play by the same \\nrules, and your, kind of your labor will result in you get what you deserve as opposed to China \\nkind of cheats, and ultimately it\\'s going to harm you and your descendants? \\n And so I think the economic piece is maybe a little easier to sort of convey.  I \\nagree when we talk about a rules-based international order, it\\'s more challenging. \\n I do think, though, aside from the economic piece, there\\'s an important values \\ncomponent, and then ultimately at the end of the day, I mean this country stands for bringing \\n\\n110110\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\ndignity and certainly more choice and freedom to those beyond our borders and that the sort of \\nworld that China would look to construct would be very much one in which certainly the dignity \\nof all people is not respected, that people have fewer choices about their own lives, and that you \\nwould see a very different and darker world, one in which our values that we\\'ve certainly \\nchampioned for our country\\'s existence are no longer moving forward but actually retrenching. \\n So I would say the economic piece perhaps is most compelling, but at least in my \\nheart I would like to say that the values piece also will resonate. \\n DR. RATNER:  Yeah, I\\'m just going to build on--Senator, it\\'s a terrific question, \\nand it\\'s one that a lot of folks are talking about behind closed doors in Washington right now \\nthinking about how do we make the case because generic statements about American leadership \\nand liberal order are not going to be enough. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  And I should add I\\'m not accusing my people back \\nin Missouri of just not getting it or something.  I don\\'t think we\\'ve ever explained it. \\n DR. RATNER:  That\\'s right.  That\\'s right. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  I mean I think when you explain it to them, I used \\nto get in arguments because I was on the SASC, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because they\\'d say, you \\nknow, the American people just won\\'t support--yes, they will.  But you have to explain what it \\nmeans to them.  \\n But I interrupted.  Go ahead. \\n DR. RATNER:  No, and that\\'s right, and I think it\\'s notable that the Rebalance to \\nAsia was a marquee legacy policy of the Obama administration and he never spoke to the \\nAmerican people about it, whereas he went on how many times did he go on prime time and talk \\nabout Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan?  So I think the communication of this from the very top \\nall the way down, from you all sitting here, from members of Congress, from people who have \\nthe time to think and research about this, is really important. \\n To answer your question specifically, because I\\'ve thought a lot about this, and \\nyou get this challenge a lot--again, it\\'s a group challenge, not otherwise--the answer in my mind \\nis you got to start at the end and work backwards because the China challenge is so incremental \\nand it\\'s so multifaceted that any one piece of it is hard to wrap around your finger and tell you \\nwhy it matters.  \\n And so what you have to do is you have to put people in the future of a China-led \\norder and make them understand what that looks and feels like and why they\\'re not going to like \\nit. \\n And Nadège Rolland, who was on the panel earlier here, she had a great \\nmonograph on the Belt and Road in which--actually, she has a full chapter dedicated to \\ndescribing what Eurasia looks like--I don\\'t know what the year is--2025 or 2030--if China fulfills \\nits economic and political ambitions in that region, and it\\'s pretty sobering. \\n And I think it does get back to, you know, for hundreds of years, the United States \\nhas tried to prevent a rival hegemon in Eurasia so as to allow trade and investment and ideas to \\nflow West and prevent security threats from flowing in this direction.  And we have a forward \\ndeployed military so that we can keep threats there and not here, and again that\\'s probably not \\ngoing to sell in Missouri, but it\\'s a reality we have to consider. \\n For things that will sell, I will say on the economic front, markets will be closed \\nto American businesses, and China\\'s industrial policies will bankrupt and run American \\nbusinesses out of business, and you will have Chinese champion technology firms in a number of \\nareas, to which they\\'re--you heard this on the earlier panel--they\\'re being completely transparent \\n\\n111111\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nabout their goal to do just that.  \\n And so if we want our economy, our conceptions of being at the cutting edge of \\ninnovation and technology, then this is really going to matter.  And I would just, I think the--I \\nwould maybe take, not to exaggerate the point, but I would take Dan\\'s comments about values \\none step further because it\\'s not just about other people overseas, right? \\n I mean what we\\'re seeing in the United States today is that Hollywood is \\ncensoring their movies because they don\\'t want to lose economic opportunity in China; \\nnewspapers are censoring, self-censoring the reporting they\\'re doing on Xi Jinping and the \\nregime because they want to have their websites up in China; universities and professors are \\ncensoring what they write; they\\'re censoring the classes they teach.  Think tanks as well because \\nof the money they\\'re getting. \\n And I don\\'t think your average citizen in Missouri loves that.  We had a situation \\nhere where a valedictorian at the University of Maryland gave a speech--a Chinese national--in \\nwhich she said, you know, she tasted the air of freedom here in the United States.  She got \\ndecimated by the Chinese government itself in official statements, by social media in China, and \\nI think the question is--again, not to exaggerate the point--but do we want ourselves and our \\nchildren to live in a world where what we see on TV, in the news, in the movies, is \\nfundamentally free or not?  And that to me is what this whole thing is about. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  I think that\\'s a great statement, and I\\'ll yield in a \\nsecond.  I absolutely think that the folks back home will support what we need to do to prevent \\nthat.  The problem is when we use terms like \"norm-based international\" and don\\'t describe it to \\nthem, and don\\'t explain it, then they default to what they are hearing.   \\n And they think that that means foreign aid or it means some big company, you \\nknow, gets to send a factory someplace else.  And so you just, you have to take it down to a level \\nof granularity. And again, in their defense, we have trouble saying what it means, right?  And \\nwe\\'re on this Commission, and you guys study this--right--and then we expect folks back home \\nto just sort of pick up on it. \\n I couldn\\'t.  It\\'s mystifying--although I thought the rebalance policy was absolutely \\nthe right policy, but it was mystifying to me that the administration did not take that out and \\ncommunicate it better.  Maybe you could write a book about it some day and explain why.  I \\ndon\\'t know. \\n [Laughter.] \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Thank you. \\n Co-Chair--Vice Chairman Bartholomew. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Thanks.  Thank you very much, \\ngentlemen, and interesting, thoughtful testimonies. \\nDr. Ratner, I too am kind of intrigued by what you were talking about, particularly in terms of \\nAfghanistan.  But and the reality of it is, of course, that China has built its economy and has built \\nits military under the U.S. national security umbrella.  And I think what you are putting out there \\nis we need to question whether this continues to make sense under for us in some locations.   \\n I\\'m not saying a retreat from the region or anything like that, but does it continue \\nto make sense for the U.S. to be paying money and blood in order to have China be the \\nbeneficiary of our presence in places, or is it time for them to step up to the plate, to be the global \\ncitizen?  So I think that that\\'s really important. \\n I want to switch just a little bit on the security issues.  Some of the things that \\nhave happened, of course, as you say, the Chinese have been pretty open and clear about what \\n\\n112112\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthey\\'re doing, but as their presence is growing on the Belt and Road countries, it provides \\nmilitary opportunities that might be there.  Railroads allow you to move troops, for example, and \\nroads, you know, they make the movement of personnel and weaponry easier if you need it.  I \\nthink always of Tibet there in a context like that. \\n But are there places, places, for example, in Eastern Europe where you think that \\nthere are going to be challenges that the U.S. military is going to have to respond to because of \\nan increasing Chinese presence, and certainly in Eastern Europe, I would put an increasing \\nChinese/Russian presence? \\n I\\'m just trying to think, usually when we think of flashpoints, of course, we think \\nabout the South China Sea, but is an increased national security presence by the Chinese in other \\nregions along the Belt and Road going to cause potential military issues for us? \\n This is for both of you. \\n DR. RATNER:  I\\'ll take a first crack and then pass it over to Dan.  I think in terms \\nof areas as far as Eastern Europe, I think the answer is no, that it is not that a Chinese foothold or \\naccess agreement is going to undermine the military advantage of the United States and NATO.  \\nWe\\'re very far from that.   \\n The Chinese for a variety of reasons--this is a wholly separate topic--but their \\nforce projection capabilities are still, they\\'re growing, but they\\'re pretty nascent.  They\\'re very \\nstrong along their littoral and in East Asia, but their ability to mobilize, much less fight, even if it \\nwere to be on the western end of the Indian Ocean, is very limited still for a variety of \\norganizational reasons, not just capability reasons. \\n So as it relates to Eastern Europe, I think we\\'re still far away off from that.  I \\nthink, I guess what I would get back to earlier, which is I think we are seeing for sure some of \\nthe goodies of Belt and Road affecting decision-making in European capitals, and Greece is the \\nmost prominent example here where they threw themselves in front of a human rights resolution, \\nas far as I understand it, that was going to criticize China, an EU resolution, breaking the \\nconsensus there, which is quite remarkable.  And I think there are concerns as well about \\nHungary and other more liberal-leaning European countries being willing to sign up for this. \\n So I think the way that, the way that it matters for security reasons, as it relates to \\nthe United States, is that these economic projects, that there will be, there may be military access \\ncomponents to it, and I know this is a bit of a punt on your question, but it\\'s the economic \\ninfluence that\\'s going to buy the political influence that\\'s going to shape decision-making in these \\ncapitals around security issues, whether it\\'s the Iran deal or something related to incorporating \\nIndia into a multilateral organization or what\\'s happening in North Korea sanctions or Russia \\nsanctions, to use your example. \\n So I think that\\'s where the rubber is going to meet the road on security issues, at \\nleast over the next five years.  It\\'s a long time before the PLA will be posing real operational \\nchallenges to the United States in Europe proper. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Dr. Kliman. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  So on Eastern Europe, I fully agree with Dr. Ratner.  The one \\nthing I would add is that you could imagine some of the frictions created by Chinese investment \\nunder BRI going into Eastern Europe will play to Russia\\'s current strategy, which is also \\ntargeting many of these same countries, trying to divide the EU.  \\n So in that sense, perhaps not even deliberately, that China will in some ways \\nadvance Russia\\'s strategy versus Europe, which is to sow division. \\n In terms of kind of other military points, I think it really depends on ultimately the \\n\\n113113\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\ntypes of capabilities that China deploys.  In Djibouti, certainly in the near future, to me the main \\nrisk would probably be those of accidents, that if the U.S. and Chinese militaries have bases \\nnearby or are operating in close proximity, we do have rules of behavior for air and maritime \\nencounters.  I don\\'t think that quite extends or it would be interesting to see how folks in the U.S. \\ngovernment would interpret that when it comes to having bases in near proximity, which is a \\nnew challenge.  It\\'s not something that we\\'ve had to deconflict before. So I think there is \\ncertainly the risk of accident. \\n Looking kind of at other locations of the world, Gwadar, I would say the \\nchallenge is probably more for India than the United States in the near term, that if China was to \\nput more military capability into Gwadar or nearby, it would certainly serve as a way to kind of \\nmonitor Indian naval activities in the Arabian Sea, and I think already causes Delhi great \\nconcern.  I suspect you\\'ll hear more about that in the next panel. \\n Sri Lanka, no Chinese military presence there now, but, of course, given Sri \\nLanka\\'s position kind of at the top of the Indian Ocean across the sea lines that go from kind of \\nEast Africa into the Strait of Malacca, again that would be concerning. \\n But to me, the real question ultimately is what sort of capabilities would China \\nput there?  Ultimately, if it\\'s more capabilities that would support evacuation of its citizens or \\nHADR, those are relatively benign. \\n If it was anti-ship missiles and more offensive capability, that would raise more \\nchallenges, but at the end of the day, I mean still these would be kind of small pockets of China\\'s \\nmilitary versus the core challenge, which is very much the Western Pacific. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Do I have time for one other question? \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Yes, sure. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Switching gears completely, Dr. \\nKliman, you mentioned the digital development bank, and I wondered if you could talk a little bit \\nmore about what you would envision a digital development bank would be?  Would you see that \\nthere would be participation by U.S. and some of our allies\\' tech companies? \\n You know we\\'re in a context right now both that we have limited money to invest \\nin things, but also American companies are under an enormous pressure from China.  We\\'ve seen \\nwhat\\'s just happened with Marriott, Google.  They are interested in trying to get into China.  \\nWhether they would be willing to participate in an initiative that China would see as contrary to \\nthe Chinese government\\'s interests, I\\'m just--I\\'d just like to hear a little bit more what you\\'re \\nthinking about with the digital development bank. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Absolutely.  To be fair, it\\'s an idea that I\\'m actually working to \\nflesh out now through research.  But where sort of it is right now, one, I think you could frame it \\nin a way that wasn\\'t explicitly countering China, that the world needs digital connectivity, and so \\nwe could frame it much more as part of a positive U.S. economic engagement strategy in Asia \\nand beyond. \\n And in that sense I think make it much more of the sort of promotion that U.S. \\ndoes already to help our companies export.  So I think you wouldn\\'t have to frame it in a way \\nthat would spook American companies from wanting to be part of it. \\n I mean you could imagine certainly foreign companies and governments wanting \\nto be part.  You\\'d also have potential tensions if you have U.S. companies and foreign companies \\nthat have the same sorts of products to sell.  But I mean to me it certainly--our companies do \\nhave an advantage in digital infrastructure that they don\\'t if you\\'re looking at building ports or \\nrailways.  It\\'s just not something that the U.S. at this point does. \\n\\n114114\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n And so I would, it would be interesting to look at whether even a small amount of \\nmoney that Congress either could allocate new funds or from kind of existing trade promotion \\nauthorities that it might be able to kind of create something much larger.  But it\\'s an idea that I \\nwant to work on and develop going forward. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Dr. Tobin. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n I too was intrigued by that digital investment bank.  So thank you for responding \\nto that, but my other question for you, Dr. Kliman, was you spoke about artificial intelligence, \\nand we know from the 13th Five-Year Plan that that is an area of total commitment for the times \\ngoing forward. \\n And we know, too, both of you know, that the military sees that as a critical \\nthreat.  Could you for the record today as we think about Belt and Road talk about artificial \\nintelligence, Dr. Kliman, and how you see that affecting the military as we look at the Belt and \\nRoad Initiative, and if you would, too, Dr. Ratner, after he speaks, if you have any additional \\ncomments?   \\n Artificial intelligence.  It\\'s a worry we know from our prior hearings. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Absolutely.  I would not want to suggest that kind of the Belt and \\nRoad plays a, certainly a primary role in China\\'s overall AI development strategy, which is \\nultimately domestically oriented.  It\\'s, as you well know,-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  --to certainly catch up to and then rapidly surpass the United \\nStates.  This is a real concern if you hear kind of American tech CEOs.  They say the Chinese are \\nonly a few years behind, and they won\\'t be behind much longer. \\n In terms of Belt and Road, to me, it\\'s more an appendage to the AI strategy that \\nChina recently had in their kind of AI development plan. There was some language about trying \\nto build AI along the Belt and Road and cooperate with countries through new research centers. \\n There\\'s honestly not a lot yet in the public domain on kind of the intersection of \\nAI and Belt and Road.  You can imagine going forward that I mean in terms of the larger kind of \\ndigital implications, whether it comes to like encryption standards or sort of how China\\'s Internet \\ngovernance model, it might be a way for China to advance that. \\n In terms of the military side, I mean you well know I mean that certainly there is a \\nkind of military competition in the AI domain, and to me the main I would say asset that BRI \\nwould be for China in that sense is AI runs on data.  Data is sort of the advantage.  And so if \\nChina can essentially gain access to more and more data along Belt and Road, that gives it an \\nadvantage that along with this domestic market where they have 1.4 billion almost citizens and \\nmuch freer rules on certainly using data for the government, that it simply gives them more of a \\nresource to play in the AI space. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  It\\'s true, and if you think about the bio \\neconomy, think about that, too, more resources that they could tap. \\n Dr. Ratner. \\n DR. RATNER:  Well, I guess I\\'ll just say I think the good news is this is an area \\nwhere the Trump administration and the U.S. government more broadly is quite focused, as I \\nunderstand it, in the intelligence community and at the White House and the State Department \\nand otherwise.  So I think to-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Good. \\n DR. RATNER:  --the extent that we lack a comprehensive competitive Asia \\n\\n115115\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nstrategy and China strategy, this is an area where there is awareness and focus.  I think the \\nremedies as it relates to CFIUS reform and other defensive measures folks are taking a hard look \\nat.  It\\'s a big bureaucratic problem.  There\\'s questions around research and development.  \\n And then, of course, the broader issue of the fact that us taking actions alone is \\nnot going to be enough here, and we need to be working with allies and partners, who if we are \\neffective at blocking China\\'s efforts to either steal or buy our advanced technologies to corner the \\nmarket on some of these, in some of these areas, that they don\\'t just then go to Germany or Israel \\nor the next stop. \\n And I think we are working on that.  But again I would come back to the best \\nsolution to this is a coordinated set of rules.  There are rules around data localization in TPP, and \\nI think, again, if it\\'s not going to be the Trans-Pacific Partnership because that\\'s a four-letter \\nword in Washington, then we can think about rules around fairness or whatever it is, and pull the \\nchapters out of that that we can work with partners, and then, of course, connect them up to TTIP \\nand the Europeans, which was the original intention of building a high-standard global trade and \\ninvestment regime, which is quite important. \\n So I think that\\'s where the answers lie, and I don\\'t have the political--the political \\nquestion you asked is the really hard one.  But the good news is that the fundamental strategic \\nand economic reasons for it are really important.  So not making it up, saying it really matters. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  One of the things that at points when I\\'m \\ndiscouraged, I say we\\'ve done it before.  We had SEMATECH in the \\'80s, I guess it was.  We\\'ve \\nhad Sputnik.  You know, we\\'ve just got to--and then Senator Talent\\'s ideas of how can we \\narticulate this better to get it moving forward. \\n Thank you. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Well, seeing no further questions, I want to thank \\nboth of our witnesses for their sharing their wonderful expertise with us today, and I\\'ll also \\nmention that Dr. Wuthnow\\'s written testimony should be available on the Commission website at \\nsome point in the near future.  \\n But, again, thank you both for being here, and we will reconvene at two p.m. for \\nour third and final panel. \\n [Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m., the hearing recessed, to reconvene at 2:00 p.m., this \\nsame day.] \\n \\n  \\n\\n116116\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPANEL III INTRODUCTION BY CO-CHAIR KATHERINE C. TOBIN \\n \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  This will be the third panel that I\\'ll \\nintroduce in a minute, but before I do, I\\'d like to give special thanks to the Commission staff, to \\nMichelle Ker--where are you, Michelle--from our economics team, to Caitlin Campbell and \\nJacob Stokes from our security and foreign relations team.  They worked together with \\nCommissioner Shea and me and with our witnesses during the recent months as we prepared for \\ntoday\\'s hearing.  \\n Thank you all very much for this joint hearing that was well put together.   \\n So on our third panel, we will explore regional reactions to the Belt and Road \\nInitiative and various competing visions offered by countries such as Japan and India.  We have \\nan impressive lineup of experts to discuss these topics. \\n We\\'ll begin with Andrew Small.  Mr. Small is a Senior Transatlantic Fellow with \\nthe Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund.  Prior to this position, Mr. Small was based in \\nthe Fund\\'s Brussels office for five years. \\n Mr. Small will provide testimony this afternoon on South Asia\\'s response to the \\nBelt and Road Initiative with focus on Pakistani responses to the China-Pakistan Economic \\nCorridor and how India is responding to the Belt and Road Initiative on a strategic level. \\n Next we will hear from a Commission alumnus, Joshua Eisenman.  Welcome \\nback, Joshua.  It\\'s good to see you.  It\\'s great to have you here today. \\n Dr. Eisenman is an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas\\' Lyndon Baines \\nJohnson School of Public Affairs.  He\\'s also a Senior Fellow for China Studies at the American \\nForeign Policy Council. \\n Dr. Eisenman will testify about developing world perceptions of and responses to \\nthe Belt and Road Initiative drawing on his forthcoming book, which focuses on China\\'s \\nstrategies in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast \\nAsia.  I understand you have various people putting forth analysis on those regions. \\n Finally, we\\'ll hear from Mr. Tobias Harris.  Mr. Harris is the Fellow for Economy, \\nTrade and Business at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA.  He is also an analyst covering \\nJapanese politics and economics at Teneo Intelligence, which is a political risk advisory firm. \\n And in looking at your background, you have advised members, senior members \\nof the Upper House in the Diet in Japan so you have a rich base to inform us on Japan.  Thank \\nyou. \\n Mr. Harris will provide testimony on the Japanese reaction to China\\'s far-reaching \\ninitiative and Japan\\'s competing infrastructure initiatives throughout Asia. \\n Thank you all very much for your prepared testimony.  I\\'d like to remind you to \\nkeep your remarks to around seven minutes so that we\\'ll have enough time for questions and \\nanswers. \\n So Mr. Small, let\\'s begin with you. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Commissioner Tobin, could I just interrupt for one \\nmoment? \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yes. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  I\\'d just like to acknowledge another special guest \\nin the audience. Alice is here. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Oh. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Your sister. \\n\\n117117\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yes, she is. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Who I met.  So I just wanted to take a minute to \\nsay welcome.  She\\'s not been to one of our hearings before so welcome. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Well, thank you. It\\'s a pleasure to have family \\nhere.  Thank you, Chairman. \\n Okay.  So Mr. Small. \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n118118\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF ANDREW SMALL \\nSENIOR TRANSATLANTIC FELLOW, GERMAN MARSHALL FUND OF THE \\n\\nUNITED STATES  \\n \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Thank you very much, commissioner, and thanks for the opportunity to testify to \\nthe Commission again.  Apologies also, the infamous flu bug that claimed Dr. Wuthnow also \\nclaimed the long form version of my testimony.  Sorry.  You only have the summary and my \\nphysical presence for this today. \\n I\\'m going to try and cover three areas: CPEC, Pakistan; India\\'s reaction; and to a \\ncertain extent Sri Lanka.   \\n In South Asia, a lot of what we\\'re talking about so far is political reactions to the \\nBelt and Road, still not yet considered economic assessments.  And I think that\\'s true, even true \\nfor Pakistan, which is the most advanced set of projects that are there.   \\n There are a lot of very high dollar value sums thrown around, not all of which are \\nborn out on the ground, and I think this is partly leading people to generalize from relatively slim \\ndata, single cases that may not actually exemplify China\\'s approach or where China itself may \\ndraw varied lessons. \\n And I think in the first place with the Belt and Road Initiative, we do also need to \\nfocus on how Beijing and recipient countries are adjusting to their experiences rather than always \\nassuming we can extrapolate. \\n The first case study for this is Pakistan, which I\\'ve testified on here before so I \\nwon\\'t kind of reprise a lot of the basics around CPEC.  CPEC has actually gone through a \\nnumber of course corrections in the early stages.  First of all, the Chinese government left a lot of \\nthe narrative setting to the Pakistani government, and this produced a number of problems.  \\n Most of the inflated numbers come from the Pakistani side.  You saw a high level \\nof politicization of the project in the early stages, and you even saw problems for China in its \\nnegotiations with other parties who started to demand similar sized package deals for themselves. \\n The Chinese Embassy started to come out with their own numbers in the last \\nperiod of time. We\\'ve seen all of these--46 billion, 64 billion, even over 100 billion.  The \\nembassy estimates about $20 billion worth of projects completed or in motion on the ground. \\n At the beginning, the Chinese also hoped to channel almost everything through \\nthe federal government.  This did not work.  They needed the provinces on board, and they\\'ve \\nsought--after a lot of the political infighting you saw in the first year or so--to try to build a \\nbroader political consensus behind CPEC. \\n It\\'s not complete, but I think at the political level, they\\'re in a much stronger \\nposition than they were in the first place.  \\n China has also come under a lot of pressure in parliament and from the media to \\nrelease more information.  I think it was clearly not sustainable for a national initiative on this \\nscale to be quite so opaque.  It\\'s not transparent yet, but it\\'s more so than it was, and you\\'ve seen \\nthis with the release of the long-term plan, more of the terms of the contracts being fed out, and \\nso on. \\n And you\\'ve also seen in the negotiations on phase two of CPEC, China proposes \\nspecial economic zones that would only be accessible to Chinese companies.  Pakistani chambers \\nof commerce complain, and the plan is adjusted.  There is a number of other cases as well, and \\nPakistan has learned lessons too.  They negotiated a lot of these deals very quickly, some on \\nrelatively unfavorable terms in the first phase, partly because they didn\\'t have a lot of options and \\n\\n119119\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\npartly just because they wanted to draw China in. \\n I think they\\'ve understood their own leverage somewhat better in the last year or \\nso.  They\\'ve negotiated even with existing projects some slightly better pricing levels for the \\npower projects, walked away from certain projects. \\n And I think if you\\'re looking at analyzing success, there are a lot of issues around \\nCPEC that we can get into, but if you look at the history of the economic relationship between \\nthe two countries, where they started from and what the expectations were going into this, I think \\nthe mere fact that a lot of these projects have actually moved ahead makes it one of the only \\nearly clear semi-kind of success stories so far. \\n The second case is Sri Lanka.  And Sri Lanka, of course, was already described as \\na kind of debt trap poster child.  Hambantota, white elephant.  But you also have in Sri Lanka, as \\nhas also been mentioned, Colombo, where China helped to increase the port capacity, and the \\noverwhelming majority of the transit trade actually goes to India.  As a result, you see some of \\nthe road developments there. \\n Now both of these cases are portrayed as sort of successes.  The whole Sri Lanka \\ncase is a sort of heads-I-win/tails-you-lose case.  Debt traps mean that China gets the rights on \\nthe port. On the other hand, there are some clear projects that have been success stories there. \\n I would still question whether China fully assesses it in this way.  Yes, they have \\nthe long-term lease on the port, 70 percent control, but a Sri Lankan state-controlled company \\ncontrols access to and security for Hambantota port, and there appear to have been guarantees \\npretty much given to India that the PLA Navy will not have the opportunity to use that.  \\n You\\'ve seen the port calls in Colombo, the sort that took place with submarines \\nbefore were denied by the new government, and I mean, in fact, the fall of the Rajapaksa \\ngovernment was partly as a result of the port calls that those submarines paid.  India then swung \\nin to help pull the political opposition together as a result. \\n Now in many ways this is a case that looks not just like an embarrassing case, \\nwhich has been able to be highlighted as a problem for China but also a cautionary tale for others \\nin how close a security relationship might get and what the repercussions even for governments \\nmight be. \\n The third and final case is India\\'s reaction.  The interesting contrast for the Indian \\ncase is Russia.  China worked very hard politically to get Moscow\\'s acquiescence to the Silk \\nRoad Economic Belt and the Eurasian Union merger, and it\\'s even, as I think we\\'ll hear, managed \\nto reach some sort of terms with Japan. \\n It really didn\\'t put those political efforts in with India in the first phase.  They \\nwere bounced into a plan that they had made as they were shaping as CPEC was moved under \\nthe auspices of the BRI, and to India\\'s surprise, and I think China is now seeing some of the \\nrepercussions in the region to that, not just the fact that it\\'s the only major country not to send \\nsignificant representation to the Belt and Road Forum, but you\\'ve seen efforts on India\\'s part \\nreally to be the most, the significant country that\\'s actually pushing back against Chinese efforts. \\n Now India is very well aware of its limitations, and these aren\\'t just the financing \\navailable to the Indian side.  It\\'s also, of course, India has a lot of infrastructure development to \\ndo at home.  China has the luxury of being able to do this after a lot of the domestic efforts it\\'s \\nalso pursued, which effectively it\\'s externalizing. \\n On the economic side, nonetheless, there are things India can do.  You\\'ve seen \\nthat with Hambantota airport, you\\'ve seen it with Chabahar, you\\'ve seen major power projects in \\nBangladesh, but India has recognized that operating alone is not enough. \\n\\n120120\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n They turned to Japan for the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor.  But India has also \\nbeen aware that political influence matters too.  India has effectively imposed certain red lines on \\nthe Belt and Road Initiative in South Asia.  I mentioned the Sri Lankan case.  I think you\\'ve seen \\nsimilar red lines laid down with the Maldives and with Bangladesh.  There are areas where India \\nsays there are things that we are not comfortable with.  This isn\\'t just an economic choice. \\n And Bangladesh, I think, is the other interesting case in that respect where you \\nsaw after concerns partly that followed what played out in Sri Lanka.  Sri Lanka--Bangladesh \\nbuying Chinese submarines has a very substantial arms relationship.  India swung in when it \\ncame to the deepwater port with a degree of political pressure, but then it was Japanese money.  \\nIn the end, I think the largest dollar, yen loan that JICA has ever made to secure the deepwater \\nport in Bangladesh. \\n So you saw the kind of combination of money plus some political muscle, I think, \\nin that case.   \\n I\\'m over time.  I have a couple of points on the U.S. response that I can add if \\npeople are interested in hearing.  Otherwise, I might can cede. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Go for it now. \\n MR. SMALL:  Okay.  Thank you. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Please. \\n MR. SMALL:  So, finally, then on the U.S. response, the other speakers this \\nmorning, who I listened to, have laid out a lot of this, and I think it\\'s in the summary as well.  \\nThe competitive piece of this relationship, clearly it\\'s partly about providing options for \\ngovernments and partly about providing information to civil society, members of parliament, \\njournalists, to enable them to better scrutinize what\\'s going on, and I fully agree that that\\'s the \\nthrust of what we should be doing. \\n But I think even with that, we have to be realistic.  Even with good options, a \\nnumber of these countries have reasons to take Chinese money anyway.  Sometimes it\\'s cheaper.  \\nSometimes it\\'s targeted to political needs.  Sometimes they don\\'t want to adhere to high \\nstandards.  And sometimes it gives these countries leverage against other traditionally dominant \\npowers in their own region. \\n In South Asia, that\\'s India.  In Central Asia, that\\'s Russia.  In Europe, it can even \\nmean the EU or Germany if you look at cases like Greece and Hungary that were mentioned \\nearlier today.  The EU money that has gone into some of these countries vastly dwarfs anything \\nthat the Chinese have put in or are putting in now. \\n Nonetheless, these countries still see certain advantages in taking Chinese \\nresources, and I think we have to be conscious of that.  I think the important thing is that \\ncountries, and particularly some of these developing countries, are resilient, that they\\'re not \\ncoerced, they have good options, and that they understand the repercussions of their choices.  But \\nwe will have to deal with the fact that greater Chinese presence is going to be a fact rather than \\nexpecting that we\\'re always going to be able to counter it even with prodigious resources \\navailable. \\n Finally, I mean there are cases where it clearly serves U.S. interests.  I think \\nSenator Talent drew out the difference earlier on between the continental and the maritime zone.  \\nAnd Ely Ratner mentioned this too.  I think in continental South Asia, there are investments in \\nAfghanistan and in Pakistan that will be constructive. \\n The U.S. has urged China to support certain power projects in Pakistan for years.  \\nJust because it\\'s called something else now doesn\\'t necessarily mean that it\\'s not constructive \\n\\n121121\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nanymore. \\n And there are even instances where it is possible to work with the Chinese on \\nsome of these projects.  U.S. companies like GE are doing so.  I think there\\'s been some quiet \\ncooperation there in some of these very select cases where it\\'s clearly consistent with U.S. \\ninterests. \\n The very, very final point.  South Asia has a problem in that it\\'s a region where \\nsecurity has often trumped economics.  It\\'s very poorly integrated.  There\\'s a tiny proportion of \\ninvestment in the region, barely one percent inter-regional by comparison with investors from \\noutside the region, a very small portion of inter-regional trade.  The U.S. has put efforts into this \\nfor some time, whether it\\'s diplomatic efforts on transit trade and so on. \\n We do need to be careful that some of these competitive connectivity efforts in \\nthe region don\\'t reinforce this, don\\'t turn into a further extension of military rivalry, or produce \\nwastefulness that just adds to the problem. \\n Dealing with the rise of China is clearly an important priority in South Asia, but \\nit\\'s certainly not the only one. \\n Thanks. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n122122\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Belt and Road Initiative in South Asia  \\n\\nJanuary 26th, 2017 \\n\\nAndrew Small, Senior Transatlantic Fellow \\n\\n The German Marshall Fund of the United States \\n\\nTestimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \\n\\nHearing: China’s Belt and Road initiative: Five Years Later \\n\\nRegional Reactions and Competing Visions: South Asia \\n\\n \\n\\nSouth Asia has been one of the most important focal points for the Belt and Road \\n\\nInitiative (BRI), with two of the initiatives’ “corridors” proposed there by China even \\n\\nbefore the broader scheme took shape. Yet their contrasting fates illustrate the \\n\\nchallenges facing the BRI in the region. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nhas become the initiative’s “flagship”, with over $20 billion of projects already in motion \\n\\nand a rebalancing of national economic strategy to take advantage of the flows of \\n\\nChinese financing. The Bangladesh China India Myanmar corridor (BCIM) has stalled and \\n\\nIndia has emerged as an open opponent of the initiative, the single major country not to \\n\\nhave significant representation at the Belt and Road Forum in May 2017 despite intense \\n\\nChinese lobbying.  \\n\\n \\n\\nFive years on, the public debate about the BRI in South Asia is still shaped more by \\n\\npolitics than economics. This is partly because there remains more speculative \\n\\nextrapolation from individual cases than hard economic data. Even in the case of the \\n\\nmost advanced part of the entire scheme, CPEC, there is not yet a settled verdict on the \\n\\nnet financial, growth, or employment implications of the projects. Much of the \\n\\ndiscussion in the region is still absorbed with security analysis – dual-use facilities, \\n\\ncompeting routes, economic coercion, terrorist threats to projects, and sovereignty \\n\\nconcerns. And the initiative has taken on a polarizing quality. Opponents portray a \\n\\nscheme that is set up to entrap countries, essentially military-strategic in nature, and \\n\\ndoomed to fail. Boosters claim it will have a “game-changing” economic impact, help to \\n\\nimprove security ties between neighbors, and promote stability and de-radicalization. \\n\\nThe provisional state of the scheme has allowed for the projection of fears and fantasies \\n\\nin equal measure.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMost governments in the region have mixed views. On the one hand, they want to \\n\\nbenefit from the potential influx of Chinese investment, draw on quickly-available \\n\\nfinancing that circumvents the need for detailed IFI review processes, and take \\n\\nadvantage of China’s growing role to gain leverage in their dealings with the \\n\\ntraditionally dominant power in the region, India. The connectivity deficit in South Asia \\n\\nis significant: the World Bank estimates that intra-regional trade accounts for only 5% of \\n\\nthe total, compared to 25% in South East Asia, 35% in East Asia and 60% in Europe, \\n\\n\\n\\nwhile intra-regional investment is below 1% of the overall sum. Although some of the \\n\\nChinese projects are rightly portrayed as white elephants, others fill genuine needs in \\n\\nupgrading the capacity of ports, addressing inadequacies in energy supplies, and \\n\\nimproving road and rail infrastructure. Yet at the same time, states in the region have \\n\\nconcerns about the security implications of a deeper Chinese economic presence, the \\n\\npotential influx of Chinese workers and companies, the quality of the projects, the terms \\n\\nof the contracts, and ensuring that closer economic ties with China do not come at the \\n\\nexpense of relations with India, the United States, and other partners.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe United States and the BRI in South Asia \\n\\n \\n\\nFor the United States, the BRI provides some obvious grounds for concern. Given \\n\\nChina’s existing track record, it would be prudent to find ways to limit Beijing’s capacity \\n\\nto translate economic influence in the Indian Ocean into political and security outcomes \\n\\nthat are inimical to the interests of the United States, and its friends and allies. \\n\\nCoordination with like-minded partners, particularly India, Japan, Australia, and the \\n\\nEuropeans, can help provide alternative economic options for states, minimize the risk \\n\\nof their dependence on China, strengthen their hand in negotiations with Beijing, give \\n\\nthem the information and intelligence they need to navigate the risks involved, and \\n\\nensure that journalists and civil society have the capacity to scrutinize deals and projects \\n\\neffectively. While building resilience and reducing the scope for Chinese coercion are \\n\\nlikely to be the main goals, in select instances where security sensitivities are high, \\n\\ntargeted political pressure, economic incentives and cooperation between partners can \\n\\nbe deployed to deter countries from agreeing certain Chinese investments altogether, as \\n\\nBangladesh’s decision over its deep-water port in 2015 illustrates.  \\n\\n \\n\\nAlthough international and regional support for South Asia’s economic integration long \\n\\npredates the BRI, the launch of the initiative has had a helpful galvanizing effect, forcing \\n\\na self-critical look on the part of many countries at the scope and effectiveness of their \\n\\nown efforts. As the U.S. “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” strategy moves into \\n\\nimplementation, Japan and India have taken important early steps in improving their \\n\\noffer, with the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure, the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, \\n\\nadditional ADB financing, and a number of other smaller schemes, while the EU will \\n\\nlaunch its own Euro-Asia connectivity strategy in the coming months. At least as \\n\\nimportant, though, is the broader framework of trade and investment cooperation. \\n\\nBilateral free-trade and investment agreements, and plurilateral agreements such as the \\n\\nTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), will do even more to define the rules and structures of \\n\\neconomic relations than hard infrastructure investments. Many of these efforts were \\n\\nspecifically conceived as a way to build a standard-setting framework beyond the WTO \\n\\nthat addresses many China-related concerns, from IPR protection to the role of state-\\n\\n\\n\\nowned enterprises. Japan, the EU, Canada, Australia, and several states in southeast Asia \\n\\nhave continued their attempts to stitch together a new set of complementary trade \\n\\nplatforms stretching from Europe to the Asia Pacific. South Asia was already \\n\\nconspicuous by its absence from these processes, and the drawing back of the United \\n\\nStates from its leadership role in global trade makes it even harder to push forward an \\n\\neconomic agenda in the region that serves these broader goals. Even in the optimal \\n\\ncircumstances, states in South Asia will, in many cases, still choose Chinese financing \\n\\nprecisely because it is non-transparent, provides opportunities for corruption, is highly-\\n\\nattuned to to the political needs of the government in power, and allows states greater \\n\\nautonomy in their dealings with India and the West. But at present, the United States \\n\\nand its allies are operating in the region with fewer resources in a competition that is \\n\\nbeing played on Beijing’s terms, rather than fully leveraging their strengths.  \\n\\n \\n\\nNonetheless, U.S. and Chinese interests are not purely competitive. While China’s \\n\\nincreasing role in South Asia is an important strategic development to address, the \\n\\nUnited States and its partners have other important equities in the region too, from \\n\\nterrorism and conflict risks to the commercial opportunities presented by the world’s \\n\\nfastest growing region. Some aspects of the BRI will undermine this agenda, but others \\n\\ncan help to support it. There are countries - particularly in continental South Asia - \\n\\nwhere Chinese investments have clear potential to bolster U.S. security goals. In \\n\\nAfghanistan and Pakistan, the United States has for many years encouraged China to \\n\\nplay a greater economic role for the sake of stability in both countries, whether helping \\n\\nto provide a sustainable revenue base for the Afghan government or addressing the \\n\\nenergy crisis in Pakistan. This logic behind this has not changed. In these cases, U.S.-\\n\\nChina coordination can play a constructive role in ensuring that projects are well-\\n\\nattuned to these states’ economic and political needs, drawing on the lessons of the \\n\\ndeep U.S. economic, financial and development role there over decades. There is also a \\n\\nU.S. interest in ensuring that trade and economics do not fuse with geopolitical \\n\\ncompetition in destabilizing or wasteful fashion. Given the scale of the infrastructure \\n\\nneeds of the region, it should be possible for supposedly competitive schemes to have a \\n\\ncomplementary impact. But redundant rather than mutually reinforcing infrastructure \\n\\ndevelopment efforts would increase the risk of financially unviable projects and bad \\n\\ndebts. Even more importantly, while in East Asia, rivals have been able to sustain \\n\\nmutually beneficial economic relationships, in South Asia, trade and investment linkages \\n\\nhave long been stymied by security rifts. The longstanding U.S. interest in mitigating this \\n\\nproblem rather than allowing the economics of the region to turn into an extension of \\n\\nmilitary rivalry has not changed either. This makes easy generalizations difficult: any \\n\\nassessment of how the United States should respond to the BRI in South Asia has to be \\n\\nbased on a close country-by-country - and even project-by-project - analysis of the role \\n\\nthat new Chinese investments and financing will play in the regional economic and \\n\\n\\n\\nsecurity order.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe BRI in South Asia: an overview \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen evaluating BRI investments in South Asia, it is helpful to distinguish between \\n\\nprojects that were specifically envisaged under the scheme and those that predate it. \\n\\nThere are a number of differences in the economic model that informed the previous \\n\\nChinese approach to investment, the level of diligence applied by Chinese financing \\n\\ninstitutions, the decision-making processes on the Chinese side, the strategic intentions \\n\\nbehind the investments, and the political salience attached to them. While there will \\n\\nevidently be many elements of continuity in the behavior of Chinese actors, the push for \\n\\nnatural resources in the 2000s that lay behind the Saindak and Aynak copper mines, say, \\n\\nis not the same as the present infrastructure-heavy approach. Equally, some seemingly-\\n\\nfailed investments from a previous era, such as Gwadar and Hambantota ports, have \\n\\nreceived a new lease on life under BRI auspices and merit re-appraisal. It is also helpful \\n\\nto base assessments on projects that are actually in the process of implementation \\n\\nrather than those that are still under negotiation, and may never see the light of day. \\n\\nSome estimates of the CPEC package now run at well over $100 billion, yet Chinese \\n\\nofficials themselves use a substantially more conservative metric, and the last few years \\n\\nhave seen a number of major investments shelved, from Diamer Bhasha dam to several \\n\\ncoal-fired power plants.  \\n\\n \\n\\nOn this basis, a brief overview runs as follows. Despite a very disappointing history of \\n\\neconomic relations between the two countries, Pakistan has attracted by far the largest \\n\\npackage of investments. Incorporating energy projects, rail and road connections, \\n\\ninfrastructure development, and industrial zones, CPEC is one of the few schemes that \\n\\nappears to match the ambitions of the overall initiative. It is also buttressed by further \\n\\nenergy projects that do not technically fall under CPEC’s ambit. After a rocky start, in \\n\\nwhich Beijing was surprised by the level of political infighting and protest in a country \\n\\nthat has been its most reliable security partner, China has secured a level of consensus \\n\\nbehind CPEC from Pakistani political elites and has succeeded in moving ahead with \\n\\nmany of the first phase of projects, which are already showing tangible results in the \\n\\npower sector, roads, and the development of Gwadar. Nonetheless, there are still \\n\\nsignificant unresolved questions and internal debates over the impact of CPEC on \\n\\nPakistan’s growth rate and finances, as well as its overall strategic direction - reviving the \\n\\nold question of whether Chinese backing plays an emboldening or restraining role on \\n\\nthe country in its regional behavior. Afghanistan, by contrast, has elicited very little \\n\\nChinese interest, with the major pre-existing oil and copper investments there in stasis. \\n\\nWhile there are tentative discussions about the development of new cross-border \\n\\ninfrastructure with Pakistan and rail links through Central Asia, progress is slow and it \\n\\n\\n\\nwill likely not improve markedly until there is a major change in the security situation. \\n\\nBangladesh has agreed a package of investments that amount to a high dollar figure \\n\\n($28 billion) but developments on the ground have been more limited, governed by a \\n\\nlevel of political caution that reflects the close relationship between the Hasina \\n\\ngovernment and New Delhi. China lost out on the opportunity to develop the country’s \\n\\nfirst deepwater port after political pressure from India and the United States, and an \\n\\nattractive financial offer from Tokyo - whose development agency, JICA, issued its \\n\\nlargest-ever loan - saw a Japanese alternative selected instead. Sri Lanka had a \\n\\nsignificant package of Chinese investments dating from the Rajapaksa era, surging in \\n\\nthe immediate aftermath of the civil war, during which China had provided crucial \\n\\ndiplomatic backing and arms supplies. This included a set of projects in and around the \\n\\ncapital, Colombo, that were largely economically sound - including the expansion of \\n\\nColombo port and the Southern Expressway - and a set of white elephant projects in the \\n\\nsouth of the country around Rajapaksa’s home constituency. These added to the \\n\\ncountry’s severe debt burden and, following Sirisena’s election in 2015, the new \\n\\ngovernment was forced to renegotiate terms with the Chinese, resulting in Chinese \\n\\ncompanies taking a 70% share in Hambantota port on a 99-year lease. While it is fair to \\n\\nsay that Sri Lanka’s debt problems are more a byproduct of the civil war than a Chinese \\n\\n“debt trap” ploy, and that the more egregious projects there predate the BRI, the \\n\\npunitive and restrictive terms of the contracts and the subsequent debt-for-equity deal \\n\\nwere undoubtedly Beijing’s own doing, and have turned the Sri Lankan case into \\n\\nprobably the most damning critique of the BRI. The Maldives is now heading into similar \\n\\nterritory: on some estimates, over 70% of the government’s foreign debt is owed to \\n\\nChina, which has taken on projects at prices that are widely seen to be inflated, made \\n\\nland purchases that required a constitutional amendment, initiated a free-trade \\n\\nagreement with minimal scrutiny, and provided political and economic support to an \\n\\nincreasingly autocratic government. The democratic opposition has even threatened to \\n\\nbring a case to the Hague against Chinese “land grabs” if it takes office. In Nepal, \\n\\nconversely, the recent change of government has brought to office a left alliance that \\n\\nhas promised to push ahead with Chinese projects - including a dam and rail link - that \\n\\nits predecessor had stalled, despite formally signing up to the scheme.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIf the first phase of the BRI in South Asia still has relatively little economic data to \\n\\nanalyze, the political impact has been considerable, particularly when it comes to China’s \\n\\ndealings with the largest two countries in the region: India and Pakistan. \\n\\n  \\n\\nCase study: CPEC, a relative success \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen CPEC was launched during Xi Jinping’s visit in April 2015, the disappointing track \\n\\nrecord of economic cooperation between the two countries gave cause for deep \\n\\n\\n\\nskepticism about how much of the proposed investment would actually materialize. \\n\\nBetween 2001 and 2011, while $66 billion of Chinese investments in Pakistan had been \\n\\ncumulatively announced, only 6% of these were ever realized. By this metric alone, CPEC \\n\\nhas been a success. While the larger numbers thrown around are often inflated, from the \\n\\ninitial $46 billion to triple-digit estimates, even the more conservative figures provided \\n\\nby the Chinese embassy in Islamabad suggest that over $20 billion is now in motion on \\n\\nthe ground.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPolitical reactions in Pakistan have gone through three cycles.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe first was an optimistic public face from the government but private doubts that the \\n\\ninitiative could be realized, after many years of a bleak investment climate and the \\n\\nconsistently poor historical experience with Chinese economic cooperation. The \\n\\nPakistani side rapidly agreed terms for many of the initial contracts that were not \\n\\nespecially favorable and the cumulative financial impact was not very seriously assessed, \\n\\npartly on the assumption that only a fraction of the projects would actually happen. But \\n\\nit had the effect of drawing China in and ensuring that a large-dollar value could be \\n\\nattached to Xi Jinping’s visit: $28 billion of projects agreed, $46 billion when projects \\n\\nthat were still under negotiation were included. This gave the scheme higher political \\n\\nsalience during a phase when Beijing was struggling to find opportunities to move the \\n\\nBRI forward tangibly on the ground. China did not initially expect that CPEC would be \\n\\nthe “flagship” for the BRI but Pakistan was one of the few countries that was \\n\\ncomfortable with offering such a wide array of projects on financially-attractive terms \\n\\nand allowing a such a privileged role for Chinese companies in the process.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe second cycle was characterized by internal disputes over the beneficiaries of CPEC, \\n\\nonce it became clear that there were real resources attached to it. This was partly born \\n\\nout of confusion about what the scheme actually amounted to, a confusion that still \\n\\naffects understanding of the corridor. CPEC was initially understood to be a transit route \\n\\nfor goods and energy to flow between Xinjiang and Gwadar port, resulting in fierce \\n\\nbattles over where the supposedly lucrtic route would go. Yet Beijing has long been \\n\\nskeptical of Pakistan’s value as a transit corridor. The land route between the two \\n\\ncountries is routinely closed by landslides and was virtually impassable for several years. \\n\\nThe cost of transporting energy via pipelines or other means is also prohibitively \\n\\nexpensive. From a military perspective, the route is extremely vulnerable in the event of \\n\\na major conflict. While there are security concerns about Balochistan and other locations \\n\\non the route, topography is by far the greater challenge. Before CPEC, China was already \\n\\nworking with Pakistan to upgrade the Karakoram Highway to a wider, all-weather \\n\\nsurface, including tunneling to reduce the vulnerability of some of the most landslide-\\n\\nprone sections of the route. But the continued expectation is that, while land trade will \\n\\n\\n\\nrise from its existing low base, the most reliable and economically efficient trade route \\n\\nbetween the two sides will still be by sea. This is evident from any assessment of the \\n\\nplans for current and future CPEC projects through 2030, where the cross-border \\n\\nconnectivity elements are modest, with no railways or pipelines currently envisaged. The \\n\\nplans instead include a diffuse array of Chinese investments across Pakistan, heavily \\n\\nfocused on energy projects and improvements in internal infrastructure connections. If \\n\\nthese elements are successful, China and Pakistan intend to move forward with broader-\\n\\nbased industrial cooperation through special economic zones and other ventures, \\n\\nbefore ultimately moving into other areas that include agriculture and tourism. Although \\n\\nthe term “corridor” is evocative, CPEC is more accurately described as an investment \\n\\npackage and an economic cooperation platform. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe third cycle has seen a more realistic appraisal of some of the economic risks - \\n\\nparticularly with respect to debt and balance of payments - and willingness on the \\n\\nPakistani side to negotiate harder on terms as a result. Implementation has also moved \\n\\nout from the federal level to the provinces, while the federal government has focused on \\n\\nnegotiations over the long-term plan and CPEC’s second phase. Meanwhile, many of the \\n\\nearly harvest projects are in advanced stages of completion: notably some of the power \\n\\nprojects and roads. This includes the first road connection of Gwadar through \\n\\nBalochistan to the Pakistani interior rather than along the coastal highway to Karachi. \\n\\nWith phase two of CPEC about to get underway, we are likely entering into another \\n\\ndistinct phase of reactions. Where phase one was heavily focused on road and energy \\n\\nprojects, phase two is focused on industrial cooperation and special economic zones. In \\n\\npractice, China had been able to build roads, ports and power plants in the past but \\n\\nprivate sector cooperation and the Pakistani export sector have always been more of a \\n\\nchallenge. There are already tensions with Pakistani industry, which does not want to see \\n\\nChinese companies operating under the sorts of incentivized conditions that China itself \\n\\nused to draw Western companies to locate in special economic zones in the 1980s and \\n\\n1990s.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIn theory, the coming years should see some demonstrable CPEC success stories – \\n\\npower stations coming online, the establishment of industrial zones that should \\n\\ngenerate more (and higher quality) jobs than the early harvest projects, and even a \\n\\nGwadar that can start to function as a viable port. But the risks of failure and of local \\n\\nunhappiness are significant, whether it be regions seeing an influx of Chinese workers or \\n\\nfurther incidents that see Chinese citizens being killed and kidnapped. All of this is \\n\\ncompounded by the fact that the next period also sees the greatest projected risks of \\n\\ndebt and balance of payment crises across CPEC’s lifetime. The first of these may come \\n\\nas early as this year, if Pakistan returns to the IMF, which would have the effect of \\n\\nmaking it appear, accurately or otherwise, that the international community is bailing \\n\\n\\n\\nout Chinese economic investments. It is also far from clear that CPEC can really fulfill the \\n\\ninflated expectations that have become attached to it - catalyzing a growth take-off, let \\n\\nalone the ambitious Chinese political and security goals detailed during my testimony \\n\\non China and Pakistan in the 2016 hearing. \\n\\n \\n\\nNonetheless, even if the jury is still out over the longer-term, CPEC can already be \\n\\nconsidered to be a partial success for the BRI given the challenging circumstances, poor \\n\\nhistorical track record, and commensurately low expectations. Relatively high levels of \\n\\npolitical trust between the two governments, a degree of consensus behind CPEC across \\n\\nthe Pakistani political spectrum and its civilian and military institutions, and alignment \\n\\nbetween Chinese and Pakistani strategic goals, have created the conditions for a very \\n\\nwide array of projects to move forward despite the clear obstacles. The nature of the \\n\\nSino-Pakistani relationship may make it a sui generis case but since it is the most \\n\\nadvanced package of economic cooperation that exists under the BRI, it will be used as \\n\\na reference point for the scheme nonetheless.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIn this sense, there is also the potential for developments with CPEC to counteract other \\n\\nelements of the emerging BRI narrative. The view that Pakistan will find itself in a similar \\n\\nposition to say, Sri Lanka, in which China can make political demands, gain land \\n\\nconcessions, and generally exploit Pakistan’s position of growing dependence to pursue \\n\\nmilitary and political ends is wide of the mark. While this might be a plausible argument \\n\\nfor China’s dealings with certain other developing countries, it is at odds with the \\n\\ndynamics of the Sino-Pakistani relationship. Pakistan is already highly accommodating \\n\\nto Chinese preferences. It has been more than open to Beijing’s requests for everything \\n\\nfrom use of military facilities to access for Chinese companies. And on the rare occasions \\n\\nwhen Beijing does choose to exercise its leverage more forcefully, it has been able to do \\n\\nso. If anything, creating a more coercive set of conditions would risk weakening China’s \\n\\nhand. Its leverage rests on a hard-earned reputation as the country that is most reliably \\n\\naligned with Pakistan’s long-term security interests, and the resulting high levels of trust \\n\\namong both elites and the public. CPEC has already proved more controversial in \\n\\nPakistan than China would have liked, and there is little appetite for measures that \\n\\nwould foster resentment in a relationship that Chinese leaders wish to portray as a \\n\\n“model to follow.” While there are good grounds to believe that CPEC will run into \\n\\nchallenges, Pakistan is a case where China is more likely to exhibit strategic generosity \\n\\nthan squeezing one of its only friends. \\n\\n \\n\\nCase study: India, a political mishandling  \\n\\n \\n\\nOne of China’s chief political concerns in the early days of the BRI was to secure Russian \\n\\nconsent and approval for the Silk Road Economic Belt. A premium was placed not just \\n\\n\\n\\non ensuring bilateral cooperation for investments in Russia itself but the coordination of \\n\\nplans between the SREB and Russia’s Eurasian Union and with it, a blessing for the \\n\\nfurther expansion of China’s investments in countries that Russia considers to sit within \\n\\nits sphere of influence. In South Asia, China would have been well advised to make a \\n\\nsimilarly comprehensive effort with India. The relationships between the two countries \\n\\nare evidently qualitatively different, and Moscow’s back was against the wall as a result \\n\\nof the sanctions regime imposed after its annexation of Crimea, but the principle - that a \\n\\nserious attempt should be made to reach a political accord with potentially disruptive \\n\\ncountries during the inception phase of the BRI - was not observed and has proved \\n\\ncostly for China.  \\n\\n \\n\\nDespite its doubts, India had agreed in 2013 to move tentatively forward with plans for \\n\\nthe BCIM corridor. It had joined the Chinese-initiated Asia Infrastructure Investment \\n\\nBank (AIIB). The Modi government had also shown interest in relaxing the rules that had \\n\\nrestricted Chinese investment in India in the past. In this sense, New Delhi was not \\n\\napproaching the BRI from a position of deep pre-existing hostility. Yet in the early \\n\\nstages, India was surprised to see a number of its ports feature on semi-official maps of \\n\\nthe BRI, for China to place the BCIM corridor under the BRI’s auspices - in neither case \\n\\nwith any consultations - which was then rendered even more problematic by Beijing’s \\n\\ndecision to include CPEC under the BRI rather than as a separate and distinct initiative.  \\n\\n \\n\\nCPEC has provided the main focus of the formal objections that India raised with China \\n\\nover the BRI, since it transits territory that India disputes, and that China has long \\n\\nacknowledged is disputed. But in reality the cross-border transit elements of the scheme \\n\\nare relatively minor, the package of investments in Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir proper is \\n\\nsmall, and other countries - including the United States - have supported development \\n\\nprojects in these territories without similar Indian objections. It is hard to make the case \\n\\nthat there is a significant material change to the status quo, that CPEC is a violation of a \\n\\npre-existing understanding, or that there is a consistent and principled objection to all \\n\\neconomic development efforts in Kashmir. In this sense, CPEC is better understood as \\n\\nderivative of broader Indian concerns about the deepening Sino-Pakistani relationship, \\n\\nthe security implications of China’s economic influence in its neighborhood, and \\n\\ntensions on other issues between the two sides, from India’s membership of the Nuclear \\n\\nSuppliers Group to worsening flare-ups at the border.   \\n\\n \\n\\nThe strength of Indian antipathy to the BRI was manifest in its decision - despite \\n\\nconsiderable Chinese lobbying - to be the only major country not to send a serious \\n\\ndelegation to the Belt and Road Forum in May 2017. India’s statement on the eve of the \\n\\nforum summarized its concerns, from the “financial responsibility to avoid projects that \\n\\nwould create unsustainable debt burden for communities” to demands that projects \\n\\n\\n\\n“must be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity”.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIndia’s response has taken three forms.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe first has been heightened attention to diplomatic and economic outreach in its \\n\\nneighborhood. Modi has paid visits to virtually every South Asian state since taking \\n\\noffice and made a renewed push for various forms of bilateral and minilateral economic \\n\\ncooperation, as well as additional investment in structures such as BIMSTEC. While India \\n\\nfaces various constraints of its own, from its lack of financial firepower to pressing \\n\\ninfrastructure demands at home, it has sought to work in conjunction with deeper-\\n\\npocketed partners, principally Japan, to expand beyond its bilateral agenda.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe second element has been the establishment - and enforcement - of some clear red \\n\\nlines regarding Chinese military presence. In 2014, Chinese submarines paid surprise \\n\\nport calls in Colombo. Sri Lanka and India had an agreement that the Indian side would \\n\\nreceive prior notification of any such visits, and the failure to do so on the part of the \\n\\nRajapaksa government appeared to portend a Sino-Sri Lankan security relationship that \\n\\nwas moving in a problematic direction. These were a catalyst for Indian efforts to bolster \\n\\nand unify Rajapaksa’s opponents, and his subsequent fate in the 2015 elections acted as \\n\\na warning to others, notably the Maldives and Bangladesh. The combination of carrot \\n\\nand stick was most strikingly in evidence for the Bangladeshi Matarbari port deal in \\n\\n2015, where political pressure and economic incentives pushed Dhaka to opt for a \\n\\nJapanese package instead of the Chinese deal that was in advanced negotiations.   \\n\\n \\n\\nThe third element has been the effort to shape the narrative around the BRI, both \\n\\nthrough public communication and private interaction with other governments, where \\n\\nIndia has been the only country to raise its concerns quite as consistently at the very \\n\\nhighest political levels. This has had a telling effect: while many countries had objections \\n\\nof their own, India has been effective at nudging them closer to their view, including \\n\\nmost notably the United States.   \\n\\n \\n\\nFor both India and China, the question is where to go next. India has been successful in \\n\\nimposing practical and reputational constraints on the BRI in South Asia but now faces a \\n\\nprotracted contest in its own region rather than having the scope to negotiate a set of \\n\\nterms with China under which BRI projects are conceived with better fit for India’s own \\n\\neconomic needs. Beijing still has the means to continue to secure projects and advance \\n\\nits economic cooperation with many South Asian governments but in a confrontational \\n\\nand politicized environment that is doing damage to the broader perception of the BRI. \\n\\nAlthough competition between China and India will certainly continue, the question in \\n\\nthe coming year will be whether the two sides are able to reach a new modus vivendi \\n\\n\\n\\nover the way it is conducted, where India is able to condition and leverage the BRI in \\n\\nSouth Asia in return for a degree of political acquiescence to the scheme. \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\nIn 2018, the BRI is at something of a crossroads in South Asia. One of the biggest \\n\\nquestions in the coming years will be whether China learns from its early experiences \\n\\nand adjusts as a result or if some of the early problems become endemic. There are \\n\\nseveral areas in which course corrections on China’s part would change not only how \\n\\nthe initiative is perceived but also its likely impact on the region. These include: the \\n\\nclosed nature of aspects of the scheme to third countries; its bilateral rather than \\n\\nregionally-focused character; its lack of transparency; the concerning approach to the \\n\\nhandling of debt issues; and China’s failure, so far, to reach an accommodation with \\n\\nIndia over strategic economic issues in the region. Some analysis holds that this is \\n\\nsimply a function of the way Beijing operates, and that these issues are - as a result - \\n\\nhardwired into the BRI. That may prove to be accurate. Yet the controversies around the \\n\\nearly days of the initiative are a sharp contrast with the successful Chinese diplomacy \\n\\nthat characterized the inception stages of the AIIB. Despite similar levels of international \\n\\nskepticism, China showed political deftness there in getting so many countries on board \\n\\n- including India - as well as demonstrating willingness to pursue infrastructure \\n\\ninitiatives that appear to adhere to international standards and complement existing \\n\\nconnectivity efforts. It would be unrealistic to expect China to turn the entirety of the BRI \\n\\ninto an enlarged version of the AIIB: the opportunity to provide bilateral, politically \\n\\ndirected investments is a prerogative that Beijing shows little inclination to forego. But \\n\\nwith the BRI emerging from its teething phase, China faces a choice: to develop the \\n\\ninitiative in the direction of a closed, Sino-centric “hub-and-spokes” model, which is \\n\\nliable to exacerbate geopolitical competition in the region and provoke further \\n\\nresistance from other powers, or something closer to an open “platform” model, which - \\n\\nwhile still serving many of China’s bilateral interests - would also be more closely \\n\\nattuned to South Asia’s considerable needs for economic integration.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF JOSHUA EISENMAN \\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT \\n\\nAUSTIN  \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\nDr. Eisenman, please. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Well, thank you very much. It\\'s a pleasure to be back here at \\n\\nthe Commission, and I want to thank the Commission staffers, Michelle, Caitlin, my old friend \\nNargiza, and of course Commissioner Bartholomew, it\\'s great to see you again.  And if I might \\njust recognize one person in the audience, Commissioner Pat Mulloy, my friend and mentor, \\nwho\\'s joined us here today. \\n\\nSo where to jump in on this.  Oh, very briefly, of course, OBOR is loan driven.  \\nAll right.  OBOR, BRI, whatever we call it, it\\'s loan driven.  And it\\'s \"build it and they will \\ncome.\"  Right.  It\\'s not about necessarily building industrial capacity or industries.  It\\'s about \\nbuilding connectivity. \\n\\nAnd in this way, it makes it unique in the history; right?  Capitalists tend to want \\nto find cheaper labor so that they can make their products cheaper so they can make profits.  And \\nin that way, OBOR is somewhat unique because it\\'s about building the connectivity into markets \\nrather than actually building capacity in those markets to export back to make more money.  That \\nmakes it quite unique. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s epitomized by three changes in the economic arena, which were \\nsummarized by Professor Ren Xiao at Fudan.  I\\'ll just summarize them very briefly.  One is the \\nsheer size of the thing is much bigger.  Second is it\\'s going out further than ever before; hence, \\nour discussion here of the implications for different countries.  And it does suggest a geostrategic \\nshift to the West, right, where China had traditionally had these relationships with Central Asia, \\nthe historic Silk Road, et cetera, whereas over the last since China\\'s reform and opening up in \\n\\'78, we\\'ve seen China mostly focus on Japan, Korea, the United States. \\n\\nIf you look at China\\'s trade portfolio, it\\'s overwhelmingly with developed \\ncountries, and this is a way to almost balance that.  And so that makes it again a unique change \\nfrom what we\\'ve seen in the past. \\n\\nSo let me break my next five minutes up into two parts.  First would be what \\nwould success look like?  And then I want to lie out for you a couple of possible risks that I see. \\n\\nEconomically, success would mean deploying excess capacity, and I could say \\nthis would be the priority, not only, however, in terms of capital construction but also in terms of \\nlabor.  China, remember, has 30 million extra men it needs to deploy.  So it\\'s not only about \\ncapital; it\\'s also about labor.  So this is very much a domestic stimulus program. \\n\\nSecond, China would have to be repaid.  If you lend somebody money, you hope \\nto be repaid, or it should gain something in return--equity stakes, what have you. \\n\\nAnd third, we would expect the internationalization of the RMB to be part of this \\nprocess.  If any one of these three things would fail to happen, it would be hard to see BRI as an \\neconomic success. \\n\\nPolitically, China\\'s influence would have to go up in the countries where BRI is \\nactive.  If you have BRI, and you have less influence at the end of the day, that is not a political \\nsuccess.  So politically speaking, China has to increase its influence, the Party to Party linkages \\nand other linkages. \\n\\nCulturally, China would become, quote, \"a cultural major power.\"  Now this is \\n\\n134\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nquestionable because China itself had a Cultural Revolution where it destroyed its own culture.  \\nSo the question of how you then export a culture where you tried to destroy yourself is a \\nquestion.   \\n\\nChina also for those of us who have been there, Chinese clothes are now Western \\nclothes; Chinese sports are Western sports.  What would exporting Chinese culture look like?  I \\nwould say this is a question mark, but Xi Jinping has put it forward so I mention it. \\n\\nAnd then strategically, China would create what Professor Di Dong Shang [ph] at \\nRenda calls \"an alternate solar system contrary to the U.S. solar system.\"  And this refers back to \\nthis idea as China as the Middle Kingdom, which by the way it still calls itself in Chinese.  So \\nthe idea of China as the middle, the kind of pole, the nexus, of trade and political linkages is an \\nimportant part of One Belt One Road. \\n\\nSo let me in my last three minutes then get into the possible crises that I see \\ncoming out of this, and we can discuss this later.   \\n\\nFirst thing I would say, perhaps most probable, and I\\'m not really sure how this \\nwould unfold, but some kind of domestic debt crisis.  Until this point, One Belt One Road has \\nbeen primarily domestic.  We\\'ve seen in Hunan alone a trillion dollars in renminbi.  Far more has \\nbeen spent domestically than internationally.   \\n\\nAnd this, this suggests that a lot of companies, a lot of provincial governments, \\nwhich had found it hard, they had been liquid short, they didn\\'t have the money, they had a \\nracking up debts, and they didn\\'t have the liquidity to do the projects they wanted, have now \\nfound a way through One Belt One Road to gain the liquidity they need and to build up their \\ninfrastructure domestically. \\n\\nAnd if you look at a lot of the maps of One Belt One Road, you\\'ll see there\\'s this \\nvast domestic component of it which starts I think in like Fujian and then goes all the way up, \\nand that domestic component is going to be a major expenditure, and it\\'s a lot easier to do that \\nbecause it\\'s within the Chinese Communist Party\\'s hands at this point so they\\'re moving forward \\non that first. \\n\\nAnd so the question is when you have a massive amount of debt, which this \\nCommission has looked at for years, and then you basically triple down on that, what\\'s the \\noutcome?  And I\\'m no soothsayer.  I don\\'t know exactly, but I do know that, you know, how long \\ncan this go on, and what we\\'re seeing is a doubling, tripling down on debt-driven growth.  In a \\nlot of ways that\\'s what the Communist Party of China has done for a long time. It\\'s not surprising \\nthat it would kind of revert back to this approach. \\n\\nDomestic inflation crisis is also something we might see, and let\\'s not forget this \\ntook down the KMT.  This has taken down a lot of governments over time.  I call it the silent \\nkiller because you never know when it\\'s actually going to strike, but if you keep bailing out \\nbanks, you keep pumping liquidity into the market, eventually the money isn\\'t worth what it used \\nto be, and that\\'s the nature of economics. \\n\\nAnd the question is what will One Belt One Road\\'s influence be on the money \\nsupply in China?  I would say an international debt crisis--if we see the kind of One Belt One \\nRoad that Xi Jinping wants to create--is possible simply because we are in an economic upswing \\nnow.  If you lend on an upswing, the downswing happens, questions of pay back, questions of \\nmoral hazard, countries coming saying I need to renegotiate, then five more countries, then ten \\nmore countries, you could end up in this rolling landslide of renegotiations. \\n\\nAnd if you did end up with a crisis, you\\'re now working at a level far beyond the \\nIMF\\'s ability to bail out countries.  All right.  And at that point, working without a net, you begin \\n\\n135\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nto be concerned about global systemic crisis. \\nMoreover, with the new bond link to Hong Kong, Americans can now buy \\n\\nChinese bonds.  If the Chinese securitize One Belt One Road debt, which they are doing \\ndomestically although not internationally yet, as I understand it, then that could mean an \\ninternational securitization.  Think 2008, 2009, in terms of the systemic possibilities. It doesn\\'t \\nmatter if it\\'s backed up by a bad house in Detroit or a bad loan to Tajikistan, a bad loan is a bad \\nloan; a bad bond is a bad bond. \\n\\nSo there is this systemic crisis.  But at this point, internationally, there isn\\'t the \\nsize to warrant a concern on that yet although domestically I would say there is. \\n\\nIn terms of security crisis, we\\'ve seen this around the world, we\\'ve seen it in \\nLibya, we\\'ve seen it in Yemen.  The more Chinese people you put on the ground, the more \\npossibility they have to be harmed, in harm\\'s way, and the more possible security crises that \\ncould emerge. \\n\\nLet\\'s not forget the history of the Opium War, where a failure of the British to in \\nterms of their product, at that point, opium, led to a military conflict.  We could see a situation--\\nI\\'m not predicting it, but it\\'s not impossible--where the Chinese find an economic crisis leads \\nthem into a security crisis whether they wanted it or not. \\n\\nIf I might just have a couple more minutes to list my last two points. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Please. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  I would say that one thing the Chinese should be particularly \\n\\nconcerned about is a speculation crisis.  If you do internationalize the renminbi, you put a huge \\namount of renminbi out into the world, and that makes it possible for foreigners to buy that \\nrenminbi and then leverage it against your country if they want to.  If they don\\'t like your \\npolicies, they can sell renminbi.  The price of the renminbi would fall; you\\'d have to intervene in \\nthe markets in order to prevent that from happening. \\n\\nSo the more externalization through One Belt One Road leads to more possibility \\nof speculation crisis.  \\n\\nThere\\'s also a possibility of a political crisis.  Xi Jinping is as human as anyone in \\nthis room.  It\\'s his initiative.  If something were to happen to him, the initiative would be put into \\nquestion, and I can just leave it at that.  We can think of many different other political crises, but \\nI think that\\'s, you know, he\\'s a mortal, period. \\n\\nAnd then I would say the most difficult crisis for China might actually be an \\nidentity crisis; right?  China is not the borrower anymore; it\\'s now the lender.  Its meta-narrative \\nof the defender of the developing countries that it has been advocating since the Mao era and \\ncontinues today could be challenged if China is seen to be a predatory lender.  If its image is \\nharmed in that way, it has serious reputational risks for the way that other countries perceive of \\nit, but also the way that Chinese see themselves and their role in the world.  \\n\\nChina is fond of telling others that it is a country that loves peace and loves \\ndevelopment.  And if those are called into question through One Belt One Road, then that \\nquestions, as I said, the entire meta-narrative that the Communist Party has been promulgating. \\n\\nSo I would say these are the potential risks, and I\\'m happy to talk about them or \\nmy written testimony.  \\n\\nThank you so much, commissioners. \\n\\n136\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSHUA EISENMAN \\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT \\n\\nAUSTIN  \\n\\n137\\n\\n\\n\\nContextualizing China’s Belt and Road Initiative \\n\\nWritten testimony for the USCC submitted on January 19, 20181 \\n\\nJoshua Eisenman, Ph.D.  \\n\\nAssistant Professor \\n\\nLBJ School of Public Affairs \\n\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin \\n\\n[NOTE: This testimony places the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the larger strategic context \\n\\nof China’s longstanding political-economic relations with the developing world.

Overview\\n\\nOn May 14, 2017, over 1,500 people, including twenty-nine national leaders and delegates from \\n\\n130 countries, gathered at the China National Convention Center in the Olympic Center in \\n\\nBeijing to hear President Xi Jinping’s remarks opening the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) \\n\\nConference. “What we hope to create is a big family of harmonious co-existence,” Xi said, then \\n\\nannounced another 100 billion yuan ($14.49 billion) for the Silk Road Fund, bring the total to \\n\\nnearly $55 billion. Moreover, he added: “The China Development Bank and the Export-Import \\n\\nBank of China will set up special lending plans respectively worth 250 billion yuan and 130 \\n\\nbillion yuan to support Belt and Road cooperation.” During the group photo, Xi was flanked by \\n\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who both \\n\\nspoke at the ceremony. Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn summed up the mood \\n\\namong the attendees: “China has taken the leadership in laying the foundations for the realization \\n\\nof our shared vision for an open, fair and prosperous world. Achievement of this vision will \\n\\nrequire our political commitment and a huge sum of resources.”1 \\n\\nFor centuries, Western observers have predicted that China would someday emerge as a major \\n\\npolitical and economic force in regional and world affairs and—as the 2017 BRI Conference and \\n\\ndozens of similar events demonstrate—that day has arrived.  \\n\\nThe pace and scope of China’s emergence has been breathtaking. Between 2000 and 2016, \\n\\nChina’s real GDP increased more than fourfold to roughly $11.4 trillion at the 2016 exchange \\n\\n1 This testimony is derived from the forthcoming book: Joshua Eisenman and Eric Heginbotham, eds., China Steps \\n\\nOut: Beijing’s Major Power Engagement with the Developing World (London: Routledge, 2018). \\n\\n138Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nrate;2 its foreign trade climbed from $642 billion to $3.7 trillion (in 2016 dollars);3 and its share \\n\\nof the global economy grew from 3.6 percent to 14.9 percent.4 Over the last three years, Chinese \\n\\nFDI, which was about $70 billion in 2013, exceed $170 billion in 2016.5 When Beijing \\n\\nabandoned isolation and began its economic “opening” to the world in the mid-late 1970s, even \\n\\nthe most optimistic Chinese policymaker could not have predicted such a precipitous expansion \\n\\nof global engagement.  \\n\\nUnder the “going out” strategy, which was first advanced in 1997 and formally initiated in 1999, \\n\\nChinese firms have been transformed from novice newcomers to global powerhouses, and \\n\\nbecome deeply enmeshed in international trade, banking, and mergers and acquisitions.6 The \\n\\ngrowth in China’s trade with the developing world has consistently outstripped that with the \\n\\ndeveloped world, and Beijing’s policy banks (most notably the China Ex-Im Bank and China \\n\\nDevelopment Bank) have deployed hundreds of billions in capital in an unprecedented global \\n\\ninfrastructure financing campaign that dwarfs that of the World Bank.  \\n\\nAfter the 2009 global financial crisis, Chinese leaders came to believe that the historic trend \\n\\ntowards multipolarity had accelerated and that developing states were becoming ever more \\n\\nimportant economic, political and military partners. China’s new self-confidence was reflected in \\n\\nXi Jinping’s notion of “major power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics” and his call to \\n\\nshape the international environment more proactively.7 China has become an increasingly active \\n\\nparticipant in international institutions, taking a leading role in United Nations peacekeeping \\n\\noperations and almost doubling its contributions to and vote share in the International Monetary \\n\\nFund.8 Beijing has also created and funded numerous Sino-centric regional organizations (e.g., \\n\\nthe China-Africa Cooperation Forum and the China-Community of Latin American and \\n\\nCaribbean States Forum) that provide regional venues for Chinese leadership. Other \\n\\norganizations like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) enhance the perception that \\n\\nChina has emerged as the champion of globalization, though it is unclear whether such \\n\\ninstitutions complement or challenge existing international institutions.9  \\n\\nSince 2013, Beijing’s “going out” policy has been expanded into the ambitious BRI initiative \\n\\nchampioned by President Xi Jinping. To cope with excess industrial and construction capacity \\n\\nand gain higher returns, the financing of infrastructure has been accelerated under the BRI. To \\n\\nhelp Chinese state-owned and private firms take advantage of new economic opportunities in \\n\\nlesser-developed regions, China has policy banks and other funding mechanisms (e.g., the China \\n\\nEx-Im Bank, China Development Bank, the China-Africa Development Fund, and the Silk Road \\n\\nFund) to lend money to foreign governments to execute infrastructure projects employing \\n\\nChinese firms. The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, unlike the others, is a \\n\\nmultilateral institution, but it is also part of China’s larger international development and trade \\n\\npromotion strategy. According to an official media outlet: “With the ‘Belt and Road’ initiative \\n\\nand other strategies serving as a powerful engine… China’s overseas investment will continue to \\n\\nmaintain a double-digit growth rate.”10 \\n\\nYet, China’s ambitious push into the developing world, now headlined by BRI, has not been \\n\\nwithout setbacks and problems. China’s economic slowdown, especially the sharp downturn \\n\\nafter 2015, precipitated a drop in global commodity prices and raised new questions about the \\n\\nprofitability of many government-driven commodity investments. Similarly, after making tens of \\n\\n139Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nbillions in politically-driven loans at favorable rates to countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, \\n\\nand Sri Lanka, China now faces problems recouping its money. The question is whether BRI will \\n\\nreverse these trends or, more likely, exacerbate them. \\n\\nAsymmetric trade and investment relations have engendered concern among leaders in numerous \\n\\ndeveloping countries, and, in some cases, drawn protests from local populations. China’s \\n\\ngrowing hard power, combined with its more assertive approach to territorial and boundary \\n\\nissues in the South China Sea, has also caused some states around China’s periphery to seek \\n\\ncloser military or strategic ties with the United States and Japan. Farther afield, in the Middle \\n\\nEast and to a lesser extent Africa, Beijing’s commitment to neutrality and non-interference in \\n\\nregional disputes are increasingly being tested as its economic interests expand in ways that \\n\\nrequire it to behave like a more traditional major world power.  \\n\\nII. China’s Strategic Objectives in the Developing World\\n\\nThere are various formulations of China’s “core national interests” (核心利益), but all assume \\n\\nthree overlapping objectives.11 First, China’s leaders seek to ensure the continued rule of the \\n\\nCommunist Party; second, they seek to maintain and defend China’s sovereignty and territorial \\n\\nintegrity; and third, they want to maintain an international environment conducive to China’s \\n\\ncontinued economic growth.  \\n\\nDespite propaganda efforts to portray Chinese policies as rooted in solidarity with the developing \\n\\nworld, the drivers of Chinese policies remain primarily domestic, and regime survival remains \\n\\nBeijing’s foremost objective, informing all other interests. The priority on regime survival is \\n\\nevident in the content and character of its diplomacy, party-to-party relations, defense of \\n\\nsovereignty norms in international politics, and in its near single-minded emphasis on economic \\n\\ndevelopment.12 As Deng Xiaoping said in 1992: “Development is the hard truth” (发展是硬道\\n\\n理).13 At Davos in 2017, Xi—in a comment reminiscent of both Deng and U.S. President \\n\\nAbraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address—said: “Development is of the people, by the people and \\n\\nfor the people.”14  \\n\\nThe emphasis on economic growth and domestic stability naturally shapes China’s engagement \\n\\nwith the developing world. Chinese leaders view economic growth and welfare as central to \\n\\nregime survival, and they view trade as a critical engine of growth. For more than a decade, \\n\\ndeveloping countries have supplied the minerals, metals, timber and energy demanded by the \\n\\nChinese industrial, construction and manufacturing sectors. To secure steady access to those \\n\\nresources, Chinese companies have, since the early 2000s, moved to purchase upstream energy \\n\\nand mineral assets, primarily in developing countries. These countries have also become \\n\\nimportant outlets for Chinese consumer products, enabling Chinese firms to build brand loyalties \\n\\nin emerging markets.15  \\n\\nImproved living standards are integral to Xi’s “China Dream,” with its goal of achieving a \\n\\n“moderately well off” society (小康社会) by 2021. For many years, officials in Beijing viewed \\n\\nrapid economic growth as essential to absorbing China’s growing workforce and avoiding social \\n\\ninstability. Since the Third Plenum of the Communist Party’s 18th Congress, however, leaders \\n\\nhave emphasized balanced growth, environmental protection, and eliminating structural \\n\\n140Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nimbalances within the economy. That said, old habits die hard. Local and many central \\n\\ngovernment officials continue to use GDP growth rates as the yardstick of success. Moreover, \\n\\nXi’s “Made in China 2025,” is a plan to comprehensively upgrade and strengthen the country’s \\n\\nmanufacturing capability. Nevertheless, as wage structures continue to shift in China and as \\n\\nenvironmental concerns mount, labor-intensive industries (e.g., textiles and leather goods) will \\n\\ncontinue to shift production to developing states.   \\n\\nThe developing world is also a locus of Beijing’s efforts to maintain or defend its “territorial \\n\\nintegrity.” After a “diplomatic truce” from 2008 to 2016, the competition for diplomatic \\n\\nrecognition between Taipei and Beijing appears to have resumed with the election of Tsai Ing-\\n\\nwen in Taiwan. In its quest to contain separatist impulses in Tibet, China periodically sanctions \\n\\ncountries and foreign organizations that give the Dalai Lama a platform or afford him anything \\n\\napproaching recognition.16 Chinese activities to secure its claims to features in the South China \\n\\nSea have included the use of hard power and coercive measures directly against rival claimants. \\n\\nChina has also solicited public support from at least 66 mostly-developing countries for \\n\\nrecognition of its maritime territorial claims in the South China Sea, and employed a variety of \\n\\neconomic and political means to purchase the loyalty of the smallest and weakest states in \\n\\nASEAN (Laos and Cambodia) to divide the organization and prevent unified opposition from \\n\\ncoalescing.17 \\n\\nMore broadly, China has found common interests with developing states on a range of political-\\n\\neconomic issues (e.g., environmental priorities and trade-offs, trade policy, technology standards, \\n\\nand the form and function of international institutions) and has sought to partner with the largest \\n\\nof them to foster a more “democratic” international order. Interests on these issues often align \\n\\nacross regime types. Despite India’s long history of vibrant democratic governance, New Delhi’s \\n\\nvotes in the UN General Assembly on various issues are more closely aligned with those of \\n\\nBeijing than they are with Washington’s.18 In Beijing’s case, support for norms related to state \\n\\nsovereignty and non-intervention are motivated by a desire to insulate itself from international \\n\\ncondemnation, sanctions and intervention related to its human rights abuses and harsh policies \\n\\ntoward minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang. \\n\\nIII. Structure of China’s Political-Economic Engagement with Developing Countries\\n\\nChina’s relations with developing countries display three principal characteristics: first, Beijing \\n\\nbenefits from and sometimes exploits asymmetry in its relations with developing countries; \\n\\nsecond, China pursues a “package” approach – bringing economic, political, and other means to \\n\\nbear in a coordinated, albeit imperfect, manner; and third, Beijing advances its interests through \\n\\na network of interlocking and self-reinforcing bilateral, regional, and global engagements. Each \\n\\ndeveloping country’s ability to derive benefits from its relationship with China depends primarily \\n\\non its ability to develop and implement a coordinated national strategy that carefully considers \\n\\nthe combined implications of these three characteristics over the short, medium, and long term. If \\n\\na developing country ignores these realities or fails to consider their full implications, it is \\n\\nunlikely to achieve its own objectives vis-à-vis China; a much larger, richer, and generally, better \\n\\ncoordinated state.  \\n\\nAsymmetric Engagement \\n\\n141Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nAsymmetry is the most pervasive and enduring aspect of nearly all of China’s bilateral \\n\\nrelationships, a fact that then-Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi reminded a security forum of the \\n\\nAssociation of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) of in 2010 when he said: “China is a big \\n\\ncountry and other countries are small countries, and that’s just a fact.”19 Indeed, China’s nominal \\n\\nGDP ($11.4 trillion in 2016) dwarfs every developing country and is more than double the \\n\\ncombined GDP of India ($2.3 trillion), Brazil ($1.8 trillion), South Africa ($280 billion).20 In \\n\\n2016, Chinese exports made up more than half of all exports from the developing world.21  \\n\\nAlthough asymmetry is ever-present in China’s relationships with nearly all developing \\n\\ncountries, Beijing can choose to either highlight and exploit it or downplay it. China’s \\n\\ncomprehensive “package” approach (discussed immediately below) magnifies the perception of \\n\\nasymmetry, while egalitarian diplomacy and calls for “brotherhood” and “equality” diminish it. \\n\\nRegional forums like FOCAC and the China–Community of Latin American and Caribbean \\n\\nStates (CELAC) Relations Forum invariably alternate locations between China and different \\n\\npartner countries in these regions. Symbolically, this places China on par with entire regions and \\n\\npractically it enhances Beijing’s already disproportionate agenda setting power. Beijing never \\n\\nfails to play the impressive and gracious host, with banquets replete with constant references to \\n\\nsolidarity, state-sovereignty, and the equality of all nation states.   \\n\\nComprehensive Engagement \\n\\nChinese foreign policy involves “multi-centric, multi-layered and multi-pivotal sub-networks of \\n\\nregional and international cooperation that are interconnected and interwoven,” explained former \\n\\nVice Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei.22 Chinese foreign policy also now emphasizes a \\n\\nbroad array of collaborative enterprises including foreign aid, educational and cultural \\n\\nexchanges, media cooperation, military assistance and training, and political cadre training. \\n\\nBeijing looks to combine these elements (discussed individually below) into a comprehensive \\n\\npackage that creates synergies among China’s various interests and allows the state to target \\n\\nresources and apply leverage to achieve its objectives. The breadth of Beijing’s “comprehensive \\n\\ndiplomacy” is well illustrated in its November 2016 white paper on Latin America and the \\n\\nCaribbean, which lists five broad areas of cooperation (i.e., political, economic, social, cultural, \\n\\nand peace and security) subdivided into 37 specific programs.  \\n\\nChina’s economic diplomacy, party-to-party relations, military diplomacy, and cultural outreach \\n\\nis often woven into a package that appears irresistible. China’s policy banks have become the \\n\\ndeveloping world’s go-to lenders. Between these, and its massive state-owned commercial \\n\\nbanks, China has 20 of the largest 100 banks in the world (ranked by total assets).23 China’s \\n\\nstate-owned and semi-private infrastructure and telecoms firms have become the face of the \\n\\ncountry’s overseas presence, building railroads, dams, airports, highways, and fiber optic \\n\\nnetworks for dozens of countries.  \\n\\nTo be sure, not all of China’s overseas engagement is state directed—or even directly state \\n\\nsupported. Chinese small and mid-sized Chinese entrepreneurs (which account for a rapidly \\n\\ngrowing, and often unaccounted for, share of overseas trade and investment) generally operate \\n\\nindependently in the developing world.24 Even large SOEs target deals based primarily on \\n\\n142Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nprospective profitability, and they have proven willing in rare cases to resist political pressure to \\n\\ninvest in deals they deem unpromising.25 Nevertheless, Beijing can influence investment \\n\\ndecisions and frequently does so to further its political objectives.   \\n\\nWhile economic tools are perhaps the most persuasive in Beijing’s toolkit, China’s \\n\\ncomprehensive engagement goes beyond economics, and aims to build a stable, multifaceted, \\n\\nand mutually beneficial set of bilateral relationships. Chinese leaders have recognized that \\n\\nbroader relationship must be “high-quality” and go beyond profits to include a “sense of justice” \\n\\n(义利观).26  \\n\\nInterlocking Engagement \\n\\nWhile all major states conduct diplomatic activities at the bilateral, regional, and global levels, \\n\\nChina’s engagement consists of a particularly tight latticework of institutionalized relationships, \\n\\nand its focus on creating or interfacing with regional organizations is distinctive in the degree, if \\n\\nnot type, of effort involved. By building a dense network of interlocking relationships, Beijing \\n\\nhopes to build a stable and mutually reinforcing structure that will further its interests.    \\n\\nAlthough China’s creation of regional organizations is among the most distinctive features of \\n\\nBeijing’s approach to the developing world, its bilateral relations remain the foundation. \\n\\nMultilateral forums boost legitimacy and visibility, but binding deals are primarily pursued \\n\\nbilaterally. China’s approach towards individual countries is tailored in accordance with \\n\\nBeijing’s specific interests there. China’s relations with nearby states are generally deeper and \\n\\nmore complex, with a mix of political, and economic interests, and sometimes territorial \\n\\ndisputes, at play. Beijing’s more distant relationships, by contrast, tend to prioritize economic \\n\\nobjectives. China’s relations with emerging major developing powers (including the BRICS \\n\\ncountries and the developing members of the G-20) cut across regional lines and also tend to be \\n\\nmultidimensional—with several overlapping political, economic, and security components.  \\n\\nAcross the developing world, Beijing has deepened its bilateral relationships and maintains \\n\\n“strategic partnerships” with some 67 states.27 Within each region, Beijing places considerable \\n\\nemphasis on its relations with large and important anchor or “hub” states where circumstances of \\n\\ngeography, politics or economics make relations with China particularly propitious. These \\n\\nrelationships tend to receive more attention in Beijing and be relatively stable over time. In East \\n\\nAsia, they include Indonesia and Thailand; in South Asia, Pakistan and India; in Central Asia, \\n\\nKazakhstan; in Africa, South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia; in the Middle East, Iran; and in Latin \\n\\nAmerica, Brazil and Argentina. This list is not definitive, and has and will continue to evolve \\n\\nover time. For example, some states, like Venezuela under Hugo Chavez, received special \\n\\nattention and financing from Beijing for a limited period of time for political reasons. Small, but \\n\\nstrategically located states, like Cambodia and Laos, are more susceptible to Chinese influence, \\n\\nand have served as useful “nail-house” votes in consensus-governed ASEAN.  \\n\\n143Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pattern of deepening engagement with regional institutions is replicated across every \\n\\ndeveloping region. Beijing established relations with ASEAN in 1991, and today is involved in \\n\\neleven ASEAN ministerial-level mechanisms across a wide range of economic, political, \\n\\ncultural, and security areas. It has maintained an ambassador to ASEAN since 2008, and has \\n\\nparticipated in the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area since 2010.28 In Latin America, China was \\n\\nadmitted as a permanent observer to both the Organization of American States (OAS) and Latin \\n\\nAmerican Parliament in 2004. In January 2015, Beijing and Latin American leaders held the \\n\\ninaugural meeting of the China-CELAC Forum, at which Xi Jinping established a target for \\n\\nChinese investment in Latin America of $250 billion within ten years.29 Notably, the CELAC \\n\\nforum, unlike the OAS, does not include the United States. \\n\\nChina’s regional diplomacy in Africa is orchestrated largely under the Forum on China-Africa \\n\\nCooperation (FOCAC), which convened its first Ministerial Conference in Beijing in October \\n\\n2000. In 2006, FOCAC was elevated to a Ministerial-level Summit, with meetings held every \\n\\nthree years. China and Arab partners established the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum \\n\\n(CASCF) in 2004.30 The CASCF and China-Gulf Cooperation Council strategic dialogue \\n\\nestablished in 2010 have allowed Beijing to expand relations with the Sunni-dominated Gulf \\n\\nStates, which had been limited by China’s close relations with Shia Iran.31  \\n\\nSince the 1980s, China has become an increasingly active contributor to international \\n\\ninstitutions. China’s participation reassures other states that it is committed to the international \\n\\nsystem, provides venues to advance Chinese interests, and helps “lock in” Chinese policymakers \\n\\nin ways that help reduce conservative domestic opposition to reform. China’s expanded \\n\\ninvolvement in global institutions also serves to highlight and promote Beijing’s efforts to lead \\n\\nthe developing world by reforming and shaping global institutions. Beijing has pushed for years \\n\\nto change quotas and vote shares in the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank, \\n\\nalthough the process has been painfully slow.32 In the World Bank, it has advocated greater \\n\\ntransparency in the selection of the president and an end to Western dominance, and has \\n\\nconsistently sought to expand the prominence of the G-20 vis-à-vis the G-7.33  \\n\\nIV. BRI and China’s Development-first Political-Economic Engagement\\n\\nBRI (i.e. concessionary debt financing) \\n\\nDevelopment with Chinese characteristics has gone global. BRI seeks to create a new Sino-\\n\\ncentric era of globalization using both traditional tools of Chinese statecraft as well as new types \\n\\nof economic incentives and debt financing arrangements. For two decades, China has promoted a \\n\\n“going-out” policy among its SOEs. Financing for Chinese-built projects in developing countries \\n\\ncomes from a variety of sources, the most important being China’s policy banks established in \\n\\n1994 to finance projects important to Chinese economic growth. The Export-Import Bank of \\n\\nChina (China Ex-Im Bank) and the China Development Bank provide large volumes of soft \\n\\nloans to developing countries under the condition that they hire Chinese SOEs to complete \\n\\nprojects.34 The loan portfolio of these two banks and 13 regional funds exceed the $700 billion \\n\\noutstanding loans from all six western-backed multilateral banks combined (including the World \\n\\nBank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, European Investment \\n\\nBank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and African Development Bank).35  \\n\\n144Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Chinese leaders conduct summit meetings, they often travel with large business \\n\\ndelegations and sign MoUs worth hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. In Islamabad in \\n\\nApril 2015, for example, Xi Jinping and Pakistan’s President Nawaz Shari signed 51 MoUs \\n\\nworth nearly $28 billion as the first phase of a larger Pakistan-China Economic Corridor Project \\n\\nsaid to be worth more than $50 billion.36 During the December 2015 FOCAC meeting, Xi \\n\\nJinping pledged some $60 billion in funding support, mostly in the form of loans and export \\n\\ncredits and $5 billion in assistance to Africa.37 Once terms are reached with a host country, funds \\n\\nmay be transferred directly into the Beijing-based bank accounts of China’s state-owned \\n\\nenterprises, which execute the project using Chinese materials and labor. \\n\\nThe dollar values discussed at these meetings hold out the promise of profits and economic \\n\\ngrowth for smaller partner nations. But MOUs are, of course, not legally binding contracts and \\n\\nmany do not reach fruition or remain decades in the future. Others involve deals for which \\n\\nnegotiations had been ongoing (in some cases for years), but which are pushed forward to \\n\\ncorrespond with a political meeting or leaders’ summit. \\n\\nIn October 2013, the BRI became the overarching framework for this effort. Somewhat \\n\\nconfusingly, the “belt” portion is continental, while the “road” portion is maritime. The Silk \\n\\nRoad Economic Belt (SREB) runs through Central Asia, West Asia, the Middle East, and \\n\\nEurope. The Maritime Silk Road (MSR) connects China to countries in Southeast Asia, Oceania, \\n\\nand parts of North and East Africa—the South China Sea, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean \\n\\nregions. Designed to improve connectivity between China and more than 60 countries, BRI is \\n\\noverseen by the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \\n\\nand Ministry of Commerce, all under the auspices of the State Council.38 Projects include \\n\\nvirtually all types of transportation infrastructure, including rail, roads, ports, airports, electricity \\n\\ngeneration, telecommunications and various other forms of connectivity.39 \\n\\nIn October 2013, the same month that BRI was introduced, Xi Jinping announced China’s \\n\\nintention to establish the AIIB, which will complement the BRI initiative. The AIIB began \\n\\noperations in December 2015 with 57 founding member states—37 from Asia and 20 outside of \\n\\nit.40 Initial capital was $100 billion, about two-thirds of the capital of the Asian Development \\n\\nBank and about half that of the World Bank.41 Although the AIIB is headquartered in Beijing, its \\n\\npresident reports to an international board, and although China holds the largest voting bloc (26 \\n\\npercent) it remains a minority stakeholder. Beijing has also created the Silk Road Fund, backed \\n\\nby China’s sovereign wealth fund but open to private investors.42 Established in December 2014, \\n\\nthe Silk Road Fund is capitalized at roughly $55 billion.43 The AIIB’s slow start and the Silk \\n\\nRoad Fund’s limited scale means that the preponderance of financing for BRI projects come \\n\\nfrom China’s policy banks.44  \\n\\nWhile there are many unanswered questions about the initiative, it is clear that BRI takes China’s \\n\\nfinance and infrastructure construction efforts to a new, and far riskier, level. Beijing intends to \\n\\nallocate at least $1 trillion to the initiative, and scores of multinational corporations, both \\n\\nChinese and foreign, are angling take full advantage.45 The framework has subsumed many \\n\\nprojects that were being considered long before BRI was launched, but the unquestioned political \\n\\nbacking implied by writing BRI into the CPC constitution may lead to more projects being \\n\\n145Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nlaunched with less careful assessment of likely risks and returns.  Because these projects involve \\n\\nloans, heavy BRI funding may exacerbate the debt problems of already poor states and further \\n\\nburden deeply indebted Chinese banks. China now owns more than half of some African nations’ \\n\\nforeign debt, and many expect Beijing will have to write off significant portions in the years \\n\\nahead.   \\n\\nInvestment \\n\\nDeveloping countries play a central role in China’s “going out” foreign investment strategy. As \\n\\nearly as 1999, China had amassed about $155 billion in foreign reserves and was looking to gain \\n\\nreturns while generating work for its SOEs.46 That year, at the Fourth Plenum of the 15th \\n\\nNational Party Congress, Jiang Zemin launched the so-called “going out strategy” encouraging \\n\\nfirms to “establish branches overseas” and “explore international markets.”47 Subsequent \\n\\ndecisions during the 2000s provided funding mechanisms to facilitate outward investment. \\n\\nChina’s move outward began slowly—and primarily involved SOEs in the extractive and \\n\\nconstruction industries—but has diversified and gathered momentum since 2010. China’s non-\\n\\nfinancial FDI flow increased from $3.6 billion (in 2016 USD) in 2003 to some $141.2 billion in \\n\\n2015—a real compound annual growth rate CAGR of 36 percent.48   \\n\\nAccording to official figures, as of 2015 about 57 percent of China’s total (outward) FDI stocks \\n\\nwere in developing states (excluding investment in offshore financial centers), with the largest \\n\\naccumulations in Asia (25 percent of total), Africa (12 percent), and Latin America (5 percent).49 \\n\\nIn some sectors, Chinese firms also have their own sizable war chests and may sometimes prefer \\n\\nto invest their own funds. Much of CNOOC’s $15 billion 2012 purchase of Canada’s Nexen, for \\n\\nexample, came from CNOOC’s own cash reserves.50 Notably, although Chinese investment in all \\n\\nthese regions has increased markedly over the last decade, it is often not the largest investor. For \\n\\nexample, Chinese investments in Africa during 2014 accounted for seven percent of all FDI in \\n\\nthe region, far less than France’s 21 percent.51 In 2015, Chinese investment in Africa dropped to \\n\\njust three percent of the global total.52 China accounted for about 9.5 percent of total FDI in \\n\\nSoutheast Asia in 2016, Japan accounted for about 14.5 percent and the United States for about \\n\\n12 percent.53 In short, China has gone from having virtually no FDI stake in these regions to \\n\\nbeing a major player. But it is not the singularly dominant actor it is sometimes portrayed as, but \\n\\nrather one among several important investors.  \\n\\nTrade  \\n\\nAnother important BRI objective is expanding and promoting trade, which enables China to \\n\\nleverage comparative advantages to grow its economy—with attendant benefits for the Chinese \\n\\npeople and state capacity. Trade growth is not necessarily purely, or even necessarily primarily, a \\n\\nfunction of state-led promotion activities, but Beijing is using BRI to tip the balance in favor of \\n\\nits firms and suppliers. Chinese corporations, including SOEs, private and semi-private firms, \\n\\noften work closely with state policy banks and diplomats, who are empowered to help promote \\n\\nexports. According to one analysis, Chinese commercial service attaches working in China’s \\n\\nAfrican embassies outnumber U.S. Foreign Commercial Service officers working in the region \\n\\nby some fifteen to one.54 \\n\\n146Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rapid expansion of Chinese trade has become a key driver of GDP growth. GDP grew by a \\n\\nreal compound annual growth rate of 9.1 percent between 1978 and 2015, while trade increased \\n\\nby an average of 12 percent. Trade growth has slowed considerably since 2012, partly due to \\n\\ngovernment policies designed to enhance domestic consumption and, more importantly, the \\n\\nslowing of the Chinese economy.55 China’s trade grew by a 3.52 percent in 2014, shrank by 9.85 \\n\\npercent in 2015 and shrank again by 4.02 percent in 2016.56 These trends are even more \\n\\npronounced in China’s trade with developing countries. Private firms accounted for 38.1 percent \\n\\nof trade in 2016.57 \\n\\nFor China, developing countries have become increasingly important raw material suppliers and \\n\\nare growing markets for its manufactured products. China’s trade with developing countries has \\n\\ncome to account for an increasing percentage of the country’s overall trade volume. In 1990, \\n\\ndeveloping countries represented only 15 percent of total Chinese trade, but by 2000, that figure \\n\\nhad grown to 19 percent, and by 2010, it had reached 31 percent. After peaking around 34 \\n\\npercent in 2012, the percentage has plateaued, as China’s economic slowdown has reduced the \\n\\nneed for raw materials and the price of oil and metals like copper and iron ore has fallen. If and \\n\\nwhen commodity prices fully recover, developing countries are likely to once again regain their \\n\\nleading position.  \\n\\nThe value of China’s trade with the developing world was $29.4 billion in 1990 (measured in \\n\\nconstant 2016 USD) and rose to $1.2 trillion in 2016 (about 33 percent of China’s total foreign \\n\\ntrade)—a real CAGR of 15.4 percent—compared to a 12.1 percent CAGR for China’s total trade \\n\\nover that period. China’s trade volume by region were: Southeast Asia, 12.4 percent of total \\n\\nChinese trade; the Middle East, 5.5 percent; Latin America, 5.7 percent; Africa, 4.1 percent; \\n\\nSouth Asia, 3 percent; and Central Asia, 0.9 percent.58 \\n\\nEconomic Assistance \\n\\nChina provided substantial economic assistance to developing states during the 1950s, 1960s, \\n\\nand early 1970s, but cut back on those expenditures in the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as it \\n\\nsought to rebuild its own economic position. Over the last decade, however, foreign aid has \\n\\nreemerged as an important part of the Chinese foreign policy toolkit, and Beijing released white \\n\\npapers on the subject in 2011 and 2014. The budget for foreign assistance has grown rapidly over \\n\\nthe last decade, with an average annual increase of 29.4 percent between 2004 and 2009. \\n\\nBetween 2009 and 2012, China’s aid disbursements totaled $14.4 billion, or about a third of \\n\\nChina’s total aid from 1950 to 2008.59 Unfortunately, the Ministry of Commerce, which \\n\\ncoordinates China’s assistance programs, does not provide year-on-year tracking, complicating \\n\\nsystematic evaluation.  \\n\\nChinese economic assistance comes in three varieties: grant aid (36 percent of the 2009-2012 \\n\\ntotal); interest-free loans (8 percent); and concessional loans (56 percent).60 These funds go to \\n\\nsupport a wide range of programs: emergency assistance, technical aid and instruction, health \\n\\ncare and medical facilities, low cost housing, education, state capacity building, infrastructure \\n\\ndevelopment, and environmental protection. In terms of distribution, some 52 percent went to \\n\\nAfrica over this period, 31 percent to Asian states, and 8 percent to Latin America and the \\n\\nCaribbean.61  \\n\\n147Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChina’s approach to foreign assistance differs in several respects from the members of the \\n\\nOECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), private Western donors like the Gates \\n\\nFoundation, and multilateral institutions like the World Bank. Rather than poverty alleviation, \\n\\nChina’s assistance, particularly its concessionary loan aid, is primarily focused on infrastructure \\n\\ndevelopment tied to Chinese business contracts. It is nearly always distributed on a state-to-state \\n\\nbasis. Unlike Western countries and institutions which often place economic or political \\n\\nconditionality on their aid, Chinese aid does not require subsequent audits and comes with “no \\n\\npolitical strings attached.”  \\n\\nThe predictable result is that Chinese aid is often easier for corrupt foreign leaders to “capture” \\n\\nand channel towards politically important regions, constituencies, and cronies.62 While China’s \\n\\nforeign aid programs could focus more on grants and interest free loans and made more \\n\\ntransparent to safeguard against abuse by recipient governments, the approach taken by the DAC \\n\\nstates and the Bretton Woods Institutions has also faced criticism. Angus Deaton, who won the \\n\\n2015 Nobel Prize in Economics for work on poverty, argues that the West’s approach to aid \\n\\n“undermines what poor people need most: an effective government that works with them for \\n\\ntoday and tomorrow.”63 Some therefore favor of China’s “development first” approach, with its \\n\\nfocus on state capacity and infrastructure.64 \\n\\nV. Soft Power with and Political Outreach\\n\\nBeijing’s impetus to become a “cultural major power” (文化大国) predates Xi. A broad \\n\\nconceptual framework was adopted in 2004 under the official formulation “China’s peaceful \\n\\nrise,” and a subsequent white paper was issued in 2011, as both a guide for Chinese \\n\\npolicymakers and an effort to reassure anxious foreigners. Since 2013, however, Xi Jinping has \\n\\nspoken repeatedly on the need to increase China’s “soft power” (软实力) by, among other \\n\\nthings, creating a compelling Chinese narrative and strengthening Beijing’s capacity to convey \\n\\nits message overseas.65 “Soft power” is the ability of one nation to shape the preferences of \\n\\nothers through its appeal and attraction at the popular, elite, or government levels.66 Because soft \\n\\npower helps shape others’ preferences, it increases the perception of congruence between \\n\\nChinese interests and those of others.67 \\n\\nAccording to Chinese analysts, the nation’s history makes it a “cultural major power” with great \\n\\nnatural advantages.68 In 2004, Beijing launched the Confucius Institute program to cultivate the \\n\\nstudy of Chinese language and culture abroad. According to the Confucius Institute Headquarters \\n\\nwebsite, in 2016 there were 500 institutes around the world. Although these are clustered in \\n\\ndeveloped countries, with 109 in the United States alone, many developing states also host \\n\\ninstitutes. Skeptics question whether Beijing-backed Confucius Institutes are being used to \\n\\ninfluence university research agendas and impinge on academic freedoms.69  \\n\\nChina promotes other types of “person-to-person” exchanges, including foreign students \\n\\nstudying in China. Beijing sponsors tens of thousands of foreign youths for training both in their \\n\\nhome countries and at Chinese universities and vocational schools. According to the Ministry of \\n\\nEducation, there were 442,773 international students studying in China in 2016, up from about \\n\\n290,000 in 2011. Of foreign students in 2016, some 49,022 received scholarships from the \\n\\n148Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChinese government, an increase of 20 percent from 2015.70 In 2016, more than 264,976 foreign \\n\\nstudents in China hailed from Asia, but thousands of students are from other developing regions. \\n\\nFor at least two consecutive years, the greatest increase was in the number of students from \\n\\nAfrica, who numbered some 61,594 in 2016, up 23.7 percent from 2015. China is looking to \\n\\nexpand job opportunities for graduates, so it can retain and utilize these young Chinese-speaking \\n\\nforeigners.71  \\n\\nChina’s influence in developing countries has expanded under President Xi, who in 2014 \\n\\nexhorted his comrades: “We should increase China’s soft power, give a good Chinese narrative \\n\\nand better communicate China’s messages to the world.”72 Chinese language schools, media \\n\\ntraining, cultural exchanges, educational and training programs, and other forms of aid and \\n\\nassistance have increased China’s soft power in many countries.73 \\n\\nMeanwhile, Beijing is spending more time and resources hosting and visiting counterparts from \\n\\ndeveloping countries’ political parties than ever before. Outreach by the International \\n\\nDepartment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (ID-CPC) is a historical \\n\\nand ongoing feature of Chinese foreign policy and supplements the diplomacy conducted by \\n\\nstate organs (e.g., the MFA) and leaders. The Party’s political outreach generally looks to engage \\n\\nin ways that avoids the appearance of intervention in domestic affairs. In autocracies, the ID-\\n\\nCPC may avoid interaction with the opposition, while in liberal democracies, it maintains ties \\n\\nwith both ruling and opposition parties.  \\n\\nIn Africa, the CPC has expanded its host diplomacy, cadre training, and outreach to political \\n\\nparties in Africa and throughout the developing world. China’s training programs are generally \\n\\noriented towards state capacity building and include, for example, training programs on the \\n\\nmanagement of agricultural technology programs. Other elements, like the political cadre \\n\\ntraining done by the International Department of the CPC Central Committee and media training \\n\\nprograms run by the official Xinhua News Agency, are explicitly political and are intended to \\n\\nimprove foreign perceptions of China and legitimize the ruling party. In 2014 and 2015, some \\n\\n2000 officials of South Africa’s African National Congress (ANC) were trained by the CPC, and \\n\\nBeijing is financing the ANC Political School and Policy Institute, modeled on the China \\n\\nExecutive Leadership Academy in Shanghai.74 Ethiopia was perhaps the earliest and most eager \\n\\nstudent of Chinese cadre training, and has dispatched delegations regularly to China since \\n\\n1994.75 During a public talk at Fudan University in Shanghai in May 2017, Arkebe Oqubay, a \\n\\nMinister and Special Advisor to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, identified party-to-party \\n\\nrelations as the first of three Sino-Ethiopian links (along with government-to-government and \\n\\npeople-to-people).76 \\n\\nOver the last decade, led by Xinhua and CCTV, China’s state-run media has advanced an \\n\\ninitiative to enhance China’s influence and international image.77 Since 2005, Xinhua has \\n\\nemphasized cooperation, content sharing, and media training programs with dozens of news \\n\\noutlets throughout the developing world.78 China wants to improve younger generations’ \\n\\nperceptions of its political system and gain elite support to counter what Beijing sees as Western \\n\\nefforts to portray Chinese practices in an unfavorable light. In 2017, for instance, Renmin \\n\\nUniversity in Beijing hosted a 10-month development studies and media exchange with 48 \\n\\nstudents from Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Training topics include China’s political, \\n\\n149Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\ncultural, media and economic studies. Counselor Liu Yutong, Chief of the Public Diplomacy \\n\\nDivision at the MFA’s Information Department, welcomed the journalists with a speech about \\n\\nChinese stability and growth—and questioned the wisdom of Britain’s exit from the EU and the \\n\\nU.S. election of Donald Trump.79 \\n\\nVI. Evaluating BRI and Countries’ Perceptions\\n\\nChinese engagement with the developing world has undoubtedly helped Beijing enhance the \\n\\nperceived legitimacy of the CPC, improve living standards for the Chinese people, and expand \\n\\nBeijing’s power and influence around the world. China has been largely successful in achieving \\n\\nthese aims, but it has also not been without setbacks, and the scale of risk has risen together with \\n\\nits overseas profile in recent years. China’s BRI and the “going out” strategy before it open \\n\\ndeveloping markets to Chinese-made products and expanded access to the raw materials China \\n\\nneeds to meet domestic demand. Its investments and loan financing for infrastructure, catalyzed \\n\\nthrough BRI initiative, have provided sustained opportunities to redeploy China’s considerable \\n\\nproductive capacity in the construction, telecom and other sectors. All of this facilitates China’s \\n\\npursuit of its centenary goals, the lifting of living standards for the Chinese people, the power of \\n\\nthe Chinese state, and (most importantly for China’s leaders) the perceived legitimacy of the \\n\\nCommunist Party.   \\n\\nWhile China’s BRI has been a diplomatic success to date, its future is uncertain. At home, \\n\\nChinese leaders understand that economic growth is overly dependent on investment and \\n\\nexports, though they remain ambivalent about rebalancing towards consumption-led growth. At \\n\\nthe same time, Beijing’s policy banks regularly finance projects regarded as too risky by Western \\n\\ncounterparts and the decline in commodities prices has exacerbated that risk.80 China’s existing \\n\\nloans to friendly governments in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Sri Lanka already portend tens of \\n\\nbillions of dollars in potential losses. China provided roughly $60 billion in loans and aid to \\n\\nVenezuela between 2007 and early 2016, and, as of mid-2016, the latter still owed China $20 \\n\\nbillion. But with oil prices stuck near $50 per barrel and Venezuela unable to service its debts \\n\\nfully, Beijing finally cut off new lending in September 2016.81  \\n\\nBRI represents a massive and unprecedented expansion of connected lending to international \\n\\nborrowers that enmeshes the already deeply indebted Chinese banking system in some of the \\n\\nworld’s most precarious economic and political environments. The lending program’s sheer size \\n\\nrequires Chinese government and party organs, many with little experience in international \\n\\noperations, to vet scores of projects across a myriad of regulatory, linguistic, and cultural \\n\\nenvironments. Many poor countries, especially in Africa, are happy to take cheap Chinese loans \\n\\nnow and let future leaders and citizens pay them back. China’s response has often been to grant \\n\\nloan forgiveness and then provide more loans, creating a serious moral hazard problem. Many \\n\\ngovernments are banking on China’s continued largesse and are thus happy to take whatever they \\n\\nare offered. However, Beijing, which saw its foreign reserves drop by more than 20 percent \\n\\nbetween 2014 and 2017, cannot write off bad loans ad infinitum.  \\n\\nBRI could also open new opportunities for fraud and corruption. China, which itself ranks an \\n\\nunimpressive 83 on Transparency International’s 2015 corruption index, is building hundreds of \\n\\nprojects in some of the least accountable countries in the world, such as Turkmenistan (154), \\n\\n150Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nKyrgyzstan (123), Cambodia (150), and Myanmar (147). On an OECD 8 point scale of risk by \\n\\nrecipient country, the portfolio of states that China’s banks extended loans between 2013 and \\n\\n2015 entailed an average risk rating a full point higher (i.e., more risky) than the World Bank’s.82 \\n\\nXi himself seemed to recognize the challenges when he called for a “stable, sustainable and risk-\\n\\ncontrollable financial security system” to supervise the BRI initiative.83 \\n\\nIn the political realm, Chinese diplomacy has generally been successful in developing \\n\\nrelationships and gaining influence. Beijing has certainly seen failures and setbacks, and has \\n\\naddressed such problems by expanding the depth and breadth of its bilateral political relations \\n\\nwith developing states and through existing and newly created multilateral regional \\n\\norganizations. By institutionalizing relations via diplomatic arrangements, party-to-party \\n\\ndialogues, economic agreements, military forums, and person-to-person exchanges, Beijing has \\n\\ncreated numerous overlapping buffers that enable the rapid return to normal relations if \\n\\nunexpected crises disrupt the relationship. \\n\\nChina’s overseas image is generally favorable, though it varies widely, depending on location \\n\\nand issue. According to a 2015 Pew survey conducted in 27 countries, an average of 55 percent \\n\\nof respondents hold a favorable image of China, compared to 69 percent for the United States. \\n\\nChina is viewed most favorably in Africa (average of 70 percent in nine countries) and Latin \\n\\nAmerica (57 percent average in six countries), while the perception is less positive in regions \\n\\ncloser to China, where security concerns weigh heavily, and in the Middle East, where many \\n\\nhave reservations about China’s treatment of its Muslim Uighur population. Those surveyed also \\n\\nhad a dim view of China’s respect for human rights, with just 34 percent having a favorable \\n\\nimpression.84  \\n\\nInfluence, which might be defined as the ability to bring about changes in another state’s \\n\\nintended behavior in ways that advance one’s own aims, is notoriously difficult to measure, as it \\n\\ninvolves counter-factual analysis. That said, China appears to have successfully influenced other \\n\\nstates on issues of marginal importance to the other state, where the costs of taking the desired \\n\\naction are small. Vague official statements supporting China’s position on the South China Sea, \\n\\nfor example, are costless for African and Middle Eastern states. Similarly, acquiescence to \\n\\nBeijing’s single-minded efforts to marginalize Taipei and the Dalai Lama, also have minimal \\n\\npolitical costs for states beyond China’s immediate periphery. South Africa, however, paid some \\n\\nprice for acceding to China’s demands when it refused the Dalai Lama a visa, prompting the \\n\\ncancelation of a conference of Nobel laureates in Pretoria.85 \\n\\nThere are few clear cases of China’s ability to translate its combined economic, political, military \\n\\nand soft influence into favorable outcomes when the stakes are high for the other state. However, \\n\\nChina’s efforts to minimize opposition to its consolidation of its territorial claims in the South \\n\\nChina Sea arguably represent a case of at least partial success. Beijing has achieved a fait \\n\\naccompli in the South China Sea by reclaiming 3,200 acres of land on seven features and thereby \\n\\nturning reefs and rocks into significant military outposts.86 Such measures have alarmed the \\n\\nstates most directly affected, including Vietnam and the Philippines, and fueled wariness in \\n\\nlarger regional states like Indonesia and Malaysia. Beijing has responded by offering a blizzard \\n\\nof trade and aid proposals and by leveraging its asymmetric relationship with Cambodia and \\n\\nLaos to thwart joint statements by ASEAN.  \\n\\n151Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChina’s impact on the economic, governance, and environmental welfare of the partner states in \\n\\nthe developing world is mixed. China is, by far, the largest trade partner of developing states in \\n\\nevery part of the world, and the loan portfolio of its policy banks and regional funds exceeds that \\n\\nof all Western multilateral banks combined.87 Chinese activity is stimulating growth and building \\n\\ninfrastructure in regions that are chronically short of capital and investment. Even in Southeast \\n\\nAsia, where Japan, the United States, and other Western countries are major actors, most states \\n\\nsuffer from infrastructure financing deficits.88 In sub-Saharan Africa, China’s aid and \\n\\ninvestments are distributed across a wider range of recipient states than is assistance from \\n\\nWestern states and international organizations. Some of the difference is explained by Beijing’s \\n\\nwillingness to engage the least savory African regimes, but it also reflects the more limited (and \\n\\nfocused) interests of Western firms, states, and international organizations in Africa.    \\n\\nNeedless to say, countries have been affected differently by their engagement with China. \\n\\nDuring the commodities boom of the 2000s and early 2010s, growth rates rose rapidly among \\n\\nresource-rich countries. At the same time, imports from China had significant displacement \\n\\neffects on domestic African and Latin American producers of labor intensive manufactured \\n\\nproducts, like textiles and food processing.89 The pattern was more mixed in East Asia, where the \\n\\nregion’s integrated production chains contribute to the specialization among states.90 Roughly 50 \\n\\npercent of Indonesian exports to China are raw materials, while Taiwan, Korea, and Malaysia \\n\\nexport mostly intermediate, capital, or consumer goods.91  \\n\\nChina’s corporations have a poor record of environmental protection at home, and they have \\n\\ncontributed to degradation overseas, especially when local governments suffer from poor \\n\\ncapacity, weak oversight, or endemic corruption. Some firms have been accused of cutting \\n\\ncorners, ignoring safety standards, using secondhand or low-quality materials and equipment, \\n\\nand building environmentally destructive projects. Complaints have come from Laos, Vietnam, \\n\\nand Cambodia regarding environmental damage and droughts from Chinese hydropower projects \\n\\nalong the Mekong River; from Indonesia regarding an ill-fated, over-budget coal power plant and \\n\\na failed high-speed rail project; from Myanmar regarding Chinese firms clear-cutting forests; and \\n\\nfrom Korea and West Africa about harm done to the marine environment by Chinese trawlers \\n\\nfishing practices.92  \\n\\nFacing growing public resentment at home, the Chinese government has become more attuned to \\n\\nenvironmental issues. It has passed new environmental regulations and promoted the State \\n\\nEnvironmental Protection Administration to ministerial status, changing its name to the Ministry \\n\\nof Environmental Protection in 2008.93 Both the Chinese state and its companies have adopted or \\n\\nsigned international compacts designed to protect the environment overseas.94 Nevertheless, \\n\\nenforcement responsibilities and oversight remains weak at home, and Beijing has even more \\n\\ndifficulties policing its corporations – especially small- and mid-sized private firms – overseas. \\n\\nChina’s lack of conditionality, lax oversight, and poor corporate citizenship contribute to, or at \\n\\nleast do not discourage, rent seeking and corruption in partner states.95 The problem is likely to \\n\\nworsen as rising labor costs in China push more “dirty” manufacturing to relocate to cheaper and \\n\\nless well-regulated developing countries.   \\n\\nChina’s expansion in the developing world may also adversely affect the spread of liberal values. \\n\\nAfter a remarkable wave of democratization from the mid-1970s to the mid-2000s, the tide \\n\\n152Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nappears to have turned. According to the 2017 Freedom House report, those countries \\n\\nexperiencing a net decline in freedom have exceeded the number experiencing a net gain every \\n\\nyear between 2006 and 2016. In 2016, 67 countries saw declines while just 36 improved.96 In \\n\\nsome countries, like Russia, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, autocrats have maintained the facade of \\n\\ndemocracy (e.g., elections and private press outlets) while stripping them of all meaning.97 \\n\\nOthers, like Ethiopia, seem to have more borrowed directly from China’s authoritarian state-led \\n\\ndevelopment model.  \\n\\nChina’s attractiveness as an economic model has increased due to its sustained economic growth \\n\\nand as neoliberal economic practices (broadly known as the Washington Consensus) have lost \\n\\nthe confidence of policymakers in developing states – particularly in the wake of the global \\n\\nfinancial crisis of 2008. More recently, however, reduced growth rates and rising debt levels in \\n\\nChina have diminished the attractiveness of the “China model.” Moreover, with the decline in \\n\\ncommodities prices, Chinese investments and debt financing for resource-related infrastructure \\n\\nhas saddled some countries with unsustainable debt again diminishing the popularity of China as \\n\\nboth partner and model. Only time will tell whether the billions of dollars Beijing has spent on \\n\\nenhancing and projecting its soft power – the Confucius Institutes, CPC cadre training programs, \\n\\nXinhua media training, film festivals, think-tank exchanges, student scholarships, etc. – will \\n\\nsucceed in improving perceptions of China. \\n\\nDespite these efforts to enhance Chinese “soft power,” however, many countries on China’s \\n\\nperiphery continue to harbor deep concerns about Beijing’s long-term ambitions and others are \\n\\ndeeply ambivalent about excessive dependence on trade with and investment from China. \\n\\nAddressing these concerns while pursuing Beijing’s material goals will challenge Chinese \\n\\nforeign policy leaders for the foreseeable future.   \\n\\nVII. Implications for the United States\\n\\nBeijing and Washington’s relations with the developing world are not primarily zero-sum. To a \\n\\nsignificant extent, interests are parallel—that is, separate and non-overlapping in either a \\n\\ncompetitive or cooperative sense. American firms benefit from improved global growth and \\n\\nimproved economic efficiencies that result from China’s policy banks financing tens of billions \\n\\nof dollars’ worth of transportation infrastructure around the developing world. Chinese raw \\n\\nmaterial purchases from Africa, for instance, are a link in the global supply chain. They supply \\n\\nChinese manufactures, which, in turn, sell their finished products to furniture stores from Boston \\n\\nto Beijing to Bangkok. But although Washington and Beijing pursue their economic and political \\n\\ninterests vis-à-vis developing states in ways that often neither directly benefits nor harms the \\n\\nother, that dynamic could change if the Sino-U.S. relationship evolves dramatically for the worse \\n\\nor if the BRI precipitates a massive raft of loan defaults that destabilizes the international \\n\\neconomic system. \\n\\nIn some important respects, American and Chinese interests coincide. Both benefit from stability \\n\\nand prosperity in the developing world, yet they attribute these outcomes to different sources. \\n\\nWashington has long maintained that free and fair elections and an open society are essential for \\n\\nlong-term political stability, while Beijing believes that economic development is the primary \\n\\ncause.98 The bloody aftermath of the Arab Spring has dampened Washington’s interest in \\n\\n153Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nactively supporting democratic change through revolutionary means, though it continues to \\n\\npromote democratic and liberal values. After the election of Donald Trump, it remains to be seen \\n\\nwhether Washington will revert to traditional modes of active interventionism or adopt a more \\n\\nisolationist “America first” foreign policy.  \\n\\nThe United States would be well served to deepen its political and economic presence and \\n\\ninfluence in the developing world. By many standards, U.S. engagement with and assistance to \\n\\nthe developing world in areas from health care and food aid, to institution-building, \\n\\nenvironmental leadership, military engagement, media, NGOs, and a raft of other areas remain \\n\\ndeeper and better considered than China’s. Yet many of these efforts gain little attention and are \\n\\nnot well understood. Of much greater concern, U.S. efforts could be severely undercut should \\n\\nfunding for the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and \\n\\nother parts of the U.S. foreign policy establishment be significantly reduced. The U.S. \\n\\ngovernment is already far less involved in promoting trade and investment than China. This puts \\n\\nU.S. firms at a disadvantage in competing with Chinese counterparts, and it undermines the \\n\\nlarger effort to maintain U.S. relevance in the developing world. Washington should increase \\n\\nfunding for the Foreign Commercial Service, U.S. Ex-Im Bank, and other federal programs that \\n\\nimprove U.S. corporations’ international competitiveness. The United States has the resources to \\n\\nmaintain its global leadership position; the question in these uncertain political times is whether \\n\\nit will choose to do so.  \\n\\n1 “Quotes from leaders at China’s New Silk Road meeting,” ABC News, May 14, 2017. \\n2 International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF), World Economic Outlook Database, gross domestic \\n\\nproduct, constant prices (national currency) and gross domestic product, current prices (U.S. dollars).

Wow.  And you can choose whatever \\n\\npace you wish, Mr. Harris. Slow or fast.  We will adjust. \\nThank you, Dr. Eisenman. \\nMR. HARRIS:  Good afternoon, commissioners.  Thank you for having me.  \\n\\nThank you also to the staff for just working with me to get me here. \\nIn the brief time I have today I want to talk about Japan\\'s changing approach to \\n\\nthe BRI because right now that\\'s actually a moving target as we speak, how the BRI fits with \\nJapan\\'s broader regional economic strategy, and what lessons, finally, the U.S. can learn from \\nJapan. \\n\\nThe Japanese case is instructive because it shows that, on the one hand, building a \\npositive relationship with China may increasingly require engagement with the BRI in some \\nform.  The Abe government has studied BRI participation as part of a broader diplomatic \\ncampaign to stabilize Japan\\'s relationship with China as the two countries mark the 40th \\nanniversary of their Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 2018. \\n\\nOn the other hand, however, Japan\\'s long road to BRI cooperation shows that it is \\npossible, and even necessary, for Asia\\'s wealthier democracies to pursue that own development \\nstrategies to help BRI members minimize their dependence and maximize their freedom of \\naction. \\n\\nJapan may not be able to match China\\'s promises dollar for dollar, but through its \\nwillingness to increase its lending, implement reforms to its foreign assistance institutions, and \\npromote private investment by Japanese companies, Tokyo has arguably outlined a possible \\nresponse to the BRI, even as it considers participating in the Initiative. \\n\\nAfter years of keeping its distance from the BRI and with the United States \\nactively opposing the creation of the related Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Abe \\ngovernment is developing a strategy of limited cooperation with the BRI.  Japan\\'s BRI strategy is \\nstill a work in progress so any conclusions at this point are tentative. \\n\\nHowever, what we know thus far suggests that the Abe administration is \\ndeveloping a strategy whereby Japanese public financial institutions, like the Japan Bank for \\nInternational Cooperation, JBIC, and the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance Corporation, \\nNEXI, will provide financial support for Japanese corporations working on BRI projects, \\nprovided the projects satisfy certain conditions, including transparency, profitability, debt \\nsustainability for the borrowers, and no possibility that the infrastructure could be converted to \\nmilitary purposes. \\n\\nIn this emerging policy, the Abe government is clearly trying to make cooperation \\nwith China under the BRI serve Tokyo\\'s broader foreign economic policy goals rather than \\nshifting its regional strategy to prioritize the BRI. \\n\\nIn the five years since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to power, his \\ngovernment has promoted a massive increase in infrastructure exports as part of its Abenomics \\nprogram for revitalizing Japan\\'s economy.  It issued, in February 2015, an updated Development \\n\\n159\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nCooperation charter that articulated the need for \"quality growth\" that is inclusive, sustainable \\nand resilient.  \\n\\nThereafter, it announced in May 2015 the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure, \\nwhich entailed a significant increase in funds for Japan\\'s public lending agencies and the Asian \\nDevelopment Bank, the ADB, as well as reforms to lending practices. \\n\\nIt also announced in May 2016 the \"High-Quality Infrastructure Export \\nExpansion Initiative,\" which included an additional increase in funds and further lending \\nreforms.   \\n\\nAnd then most recently, in 2017, announced that it would with India pursue an \\nAsia-Africa Growth Corridor, a maritime connectivity project to enhance trade links between \\nSouth and Southeast Asia and East Africa.   \\n\\nAdditionally, even as Mr. Small discussed India has remained out of the BRI, \\nJapan has stepped up its official development assistance and public and private lending to India, \\ndemonstrating how China\\'s rivals can use regional anxieties about the BRI to their advantage.   \\n\\nThese steps plus Japan\\'s embrace of new rules for trade and investment in East \\nAsia through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which as we saw this week is now moving forward \\nwithout the United States, amount to a comprehensive strategy for competing with China for \\ninfluence across the Indo-Pacific. \\n\\nAs such, the Abe government is not ceding leadership in regional development to \\nChina, but it is recognizing that the Initiative does bring much needed investment to the region--\\ninvestment that Japan and the ADB have long recognized is necessary--and that whether or not \\nJapan participates, the BRI will go forward and could reshape the region over the coming \\ndecades. \\n\\nBy endorsing participation by Japanese firms, the Abe government will tacitly \\nacknowledge this reality and try to find ways for Japan to profit from the BRI and perhaps shape \\nthe Initiative on the margins in a way more friendly to Japanese interests and values. \\n\\nHaving articulated and pursued an independent strategy, Tokyo can pursue \\ncooperation with China on its own terms. \\n\\nI think at this point it\\'s worth noting the contrast with Australia, another Indo-\\nPacific maritime democracy with a complex interdependent relationship with China.  Australia \\nhas shared Japan\\'s interest in high-quality infrastructure to meet Asia\\'s infrastructure gap, but \\nunlike Japan has not revamped its development institutions or increased its development \\nassistance and lending. \\n\\nUnlike Japan, Australia joined the AIIB as a founding member in 2015, which \\nperhaps signaled a greater willingness to work with China on infrastructure than Canberra \\nintended.  In the three years since Australia joined the AIIB, it has lurched between talks with \\nBeijing on BRI participation and hostility and perhaps even fearmongering regarding China\\'s \\nintentions, including most recently a direct jab at Chinese development assistance in the South \\nPacific by Australia\\'s Minister for International Development. \\n\\nWhereas Japan has kept its distance from the BRI and articulated its own regional \\ndevelopment strategy, Australia was quick to lend its support for a key institution but grew \\nambivalent and is now struggling to articulate an independent development strategy. \\n\\nIn fairness, this partly reflects Australia\\'s smaller economy and smaller resources, \\nwhich has led Australia to focus more on soft infrastructure rather than hard infrastructure.  But \\nprecisely for that reason, Australia needs to identify its priorities, upgrade its institutions, perhaps \\ncreating development finance institutions like Japan\\'s, and collaborate with regional partners to \\n\\n160\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\npromote high-quality infrastructure investment. \\nIf the BRI will be a fixture in Asia\\'s economics and politics, the region\\'s \\n\\ndeveloped democracies need their own plans for promoting development, particularly in the \\nregion\\'s middle income countries.  Without a regional trade strategy aimed at middle-income \\nAsia, it is imperative for the U.S. to develop a development strategy that uses bilateral foreign \\naid, cooperation with the ADB and other multilateral lending institutions, and perhaps most \\nimportantly incentives to encourage private infrastructure investment in South and Southeast \\nAsia. \\n\\nGiven Japan\\'s existing capabilities and influence, the U.S. should coordinate \\nclosely with Japan and follow Tokyo\\'s lead in stressing the importance of high-quality \\ninfrastructure.  Developing a joint regional development strategy could be an appropriate agenda \\nitem for the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue, as well as for future meetings of the U.S.-Japan-\\nAustralia-India quadrilateral. \\n\\nBoth the administration and Congress deserve credit for taking steps to maintain \\nand even expand U.S. capacity for global development, first by preserving the Export-Import \\nBank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC, and going forward, through \\npending legislation to roll OPIC into a new, more robust development finance corporation. \\n\\nStrengthening capacity for supporting private efforts to meet Asia\\'s infrastructure \\nneeds will make it possible for the United States to work more closely with its partners to \\ndevelop an allied approach to regional development that may not supplant BRI but will give the \\ndeveloping countries of South and Southeast Asia more freedom of action even as Chinese \\ninvestment proceeds. \\n\\nWith that, I will conclude my prepared remarks.  Thank you for your time. \\n\\n161\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF TOBIAS HARRIS \\nECONOMY, TRADE, AND BUSINESS FELLOW, SASAKAWA PEACE FOUNDATION \\n\\nUSA  \\n\\n162\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\\n\\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative: Five Years Later\\nRegional Reactions and Competing Visions\\n\\n25 January 2018\\n\\nTobias Harris \\nVice President, Teneo Intelligence \\n\\nEconomy, Trade, and Business Fellow, Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA \\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to testify before the U.S.-China Economic \\nSecurity Review Commission today on the subject of regional reactions to China’s Belt \\nand Road Initiative (BRI). China’s USD 1tn program of infrastructure investment \\npresents opportunities for its sixty-five member countries to develop, while also raising \\nrisks of over-dependence on Chinese investment, unsustainable borrowing, and high \\nenvironmental and social costs for host nations.1 \\n\\nThe risks and opportunities of the BRI extend even to Asia’s developed democracies, \\nwhich already have complex economic relationships with China and interests in \\npromoting development across Asia. In my remarks today I will focus on how Japan – \\nwhich is in the process of developing a strategy of limited engagement with the BRI – \\nhas responded to the BRI, touching briefly on Australia to show some of the difficulties \\npresented by the BRI. The Japanese case is particularly instructive because it shows \\nthat on the one hand, building a positive relationship with China may increasingly \\nrequire engagement with the BRI in some form, while, on the other hand, showing that it \\nis possible and even necessary for Asia’s wealthier democracies to pursue their own \\ndevelopment strategies to help BRI members minimize their dependence on China and \\nmaximize their freedom of action. Japan may not be able to match China’s promises \\ndollar for dollar, but through its willingness to increase its lending, loosen rules and \\nimplement other reforms to its foreign assistance institutions, and to promote private \\ninvestment by Japanese companies Tokyo has arguably outlined a possible response to \\nthe BRI even as it considers participating in the BRI. \\n\\nJapan’s approach to the BRI not only provides a model for the US consider as it \\nformulates its own Asia policies, but also is an opportunity for the US to strengthen its \\nrelationships with Japan, Australia, and, increasingly, India, as they all determine how to \\nrespond to the BRI. \\n\\n163Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nJapan’s shift on the BRI\\n\\nAs we meet today, Japan’s approach to China’s Belt and Road Initiative is a moving \\ntarget. After years of keeping its distance from the BRI – and, with the United States, \\nactively opposing the creation of the related Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) \\n– the Abe government has signaled that it is developing a strategy of limited\\ncooperation with the BRI. Japan’s BRI strategy is still a work in progress, so our\\ndiscussion today must by necessity be tentative. However, what we know thus far\\nsuggests that the Abe administration is developing a strategy whereby Japanese public\\nfinancial institutions like the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and\\nNippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) will provide financial support for\\nJapanese corporations working on BRI projects, provided the projects satisfy certain\\nconditions, including transparency, profitability, debt sustainability for the borrower, and\\nno possibility that the infrastructure could be converted to military purposes. Early\\nreports suggest that public finance will focus on backing joint Japan-China projects\\nregarding the development of renewable energy infrastructure in third countries,\\npromoting high-speed industrialization in third countries, and the proposed rail\\nconnection between China and Europe.2\\n\\nThese conditions are largely consistent with the Abe administration’s focus on “high-\\nquality” infrastructure investment, and, as such, do not necessarily signify a sharp break \\nwith its prevailing approach to regional development or its broader foreign economic \\npolicies. Instead, from what we know of the Abe government’s approach, the emerging \\npolicy shift is likely driven by pragmatic calculations that recognize the role that China \\nand the BRI will play in regional development, infrastructure investment, trade \\nfacilitation, and connectivity not just within Asia but between Asia and other regions. \\nThe Abe government is not ceding leadership in regional development to China but it is \\nrecognizing that the initiative does bring much-needed investment to the region – \\ninvestment that Japan and the Japan-led Asian Development Bank (ADB)3 have long \\nrecognized as necessary – and that whether or not Japan participates, the BRI will go \\nforward and could reshape Asia and much of the developing world over the coming \\ndecades. By endorsing participation by Japanese firms, the Abe government will tacitly \\nacknowledge this reality and try to find ways for Japan to profit from the BRI and \\nperhaps shape the initiative on the margins in a way more friendly to Japanese interests \\nand values. \\n\\nThe Abe administration’s shift is part of a broad recalibration of Japan’s foreign \\neconomic policies since the United States withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership \\nin January 2017. From Abe’s decision to join TPP talks in March 2013, the regional \\ntrade pact had been the predominant focus of the Abe administration’s foreign \\neconomic policy, as it provided a framework not only for addressing longstanding issues \\nin its bilateral relationship with the United States but also established “high-quality” rules \\nthat would govern trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific in the twenty-first century. \\nWhile TPP’s origins predate the BRI, as the talks proceeded, it became increasingly \\nclear that for Japan, TPP was at least part of its answer to the BRI. While not explicitly \\nfocused on helping middle-income economies develop, the inclusion of Vietnam and \\n\\n164Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nMalaysia and the prospect of other Southeast Asian countries joining the bloc in the \\nfuture suggested an approach to development in which developing countries would, in \\nexchange for access to the markets of the US and other wealthy members (making \\nthem the agreement’s biggest beneficiaries in GDP terms4), undertake politically difficult \\ndomestic reforms that could fundamentally restructure their economies. As long as the \\nAbe administration was focused on implementing TPP as it was signed in February \\n2016, it could afford to remain aloof from the emerging China-led framework for regional \\ndevelopment.  \\n\\nUS withdrawal severely undermined the concept of TPP as development model, forcing \\nthe Abe government to rethink its overall approach to trade, investment, and \\ndevelopment in Asia. While Tokyo eventually decided to lead the bid to revive the TPP \\nwithout the US – now the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-\\nPacific Partnership (CPTPP) – without the US, it was not nearly as beneficial or as \\nappealing to the developing-country members, and Vietnam and Malaysia repeatedly \\nsignaled their skepticism about the post-US TPP. The Abe government appeared more \\nsupportive of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) after the US \\nleft TPP, but the larger, more economically diverse membership of RCEP meant that it \\nwas never going to satisfy Japan’s desire to advance higher standards for regional \\nintegration – and it is possible that the Abe government’s insistence on raising RCEP’s \\nstandards, which Abe and other officials repeated after the US withdrew from TPP, \\nindicated that Tokyo was more interested in slowing RCEP’s progress rather than \\nguiding them to completion. The other difference, of course, is that RCEP included \\nChina, meaning that unlike TPP it would not be a tool for reshaping China’s economic \\npractices or help Asian countries reduce their dependence on China. Therefore, after \\nthe US withdrawal from TPP, Japan was left with a trade agreement that did not have \\nthe same appeal to middle-income Asia while facing a China that was aggressively \\nexpanding its ambitions for integration through the BRI framework. \\n\\nThe result is that beginning in spring 2017 the Abe administration began articulating a \\nmulti-faceted updating of its foreign economic policies. Despite Abe’s dismissing the \\nvalue of TPP without the US on multiple occasions,5 the prime minister decided that \\nJapan would throw its weight behind efforts to revive the agreement without the US and \\nset an ambitious goal of finalizing the revisions by the Asia Pacific Economic \\nCooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam in November 2017. Additionally, it would also \\npush to conclude an economic partnership agreement (EPA) with the European Union, \\ntalks for which had begun in 2013. By pursuing these agreements, especially the TPP-\\n11, Japan would show that even as the US shifted away from multilateral to bilateral \\nand unilateral approaches to trade, the multilateral trading system was still deepening \\non multiple fronts – and Japan was still invested in advancing new rules to govern \\ncommerce in the twenty-first century. Meanwhile, in May Japan and India announced \\nthe creation of the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), an infrastructure investment \\ninitiative that appeared to be a direct challenge to the BRI. \\n\\nAt the same time, however, the Abe government began quietly but purposefully \\nsignaling to Beijing that Japan is open to participating in the BRI in some capacity. Even \\n\\n165Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nas Japan was resurrecting TPP and assuming leadership of the bloc of eleven, the Abe \\ngovernment began making overtures to Beijing. The clearest sign of a shift came in mid-\\nMay, when Abe dispatched Takuya Imai, his principal private secretary, along with the \\nLiberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) secretary general Toshiro Nikai, widely regarded as a \\nleading LDP “China hand” to Beijing to attend the Belt and Road Forum. During this \\nvisit, Nikai met with Xi and conveyed a letter from Abe expressing the prime minister’s \\nhopes for an exchange of visits and more constructive bilateral engagement. This \\ndelegation communicated the Abe administration’s seriousness regarding \\nrapprochement with Beijing, in which cooperation under the auspices of the BRI could \\nplay a central role.  \\n\\nWhen Abe met Xi on the sidelines of the G20 in Hamburg in July 2017, the joint \\nstatement included the first mention of BRI – “Japan and China will discuss how to \\ncontribute to the stability and prosperity of the region and the world, including the One \\nBelt, One Road initiative.”6 By November, when Abe met Xi and Chinese Premier Li \\nKeqiang on the sidelines of APEC, the language had been upgraded: the joint \\nstatement with Xi now said, “The two sides shared the view [emphasis added] that they \\nwill together discuss how Japan and China will contribute to the stability and prosperity \\nof the region and the world, including the ‘the Belt and Road’ Initiatives.”7 The joint \\nstatement from Abe’s meeting with Li two days later included the same language but \\nalso noted:  \\n\\nBoth sides shared the view that Japan and China should cooperate with each \\nother in order to deepen and expand their win-win economic relationship, and \\nthat developing Japanese and Chinese businesses in third countries will be \\nbeneficial not just to Japan and China but to the development of the countries \\nconcerned as well. They also shared the view that exchanges in the business \\ncommunity should be promoted.8 \\n\\nThis point from the Abe-Li summit is particularly important because it directly anticipates \\nthe policy approach the Abe government eventually indicated it would adopt in \\nDecember 2017, whereby it would provide financial support for Japanese firms working \\non BRI projects but not directly participate in the BRI or join the AIIB. This trajectory has \\ncontinued since the start of 2018. On 10 January, Abe met with Nikai and Yoshihisa \\nInoue, secretary-general of the LDP’s coalition partner Komeito (which has its own \\nconnections to China) and reiterated that Japan’s cooperation with the BRI would be on \\na case-by-case basis, with decisions made on the basis of the aforementioned criteria \\nas well as from consideration of China’s preferences.9 \\n\\nPolitical drivers\\n\\nAs surprising as Japan’s embrace of the BRI has been, it bears stressing that Japan’s \\nembrace is thus far not only still pending but also looks to be modest: private-sector-led \\ninvestment with government backing, with no indication that Japan will change its \\nstance on non-participation in the AIIB. While Tokyo is learning to live with the evolving \\nChina-led development regime, it is not prepared to jump in with both feet and, as will \\n\\n166Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nbe discussed in the next section, is still focused on its own initiatives. This is not a grand \\nstrategic realignment, the birth of something like what former Prime Minister Yukio \\nHatoyama called an “East Asian Community.”10 Rather, it is driven mainly by domestic \\npolitical considerations, which, as the Council on Foreign Relation’s Sheila Smith has \\nnoted, have increasingly played an outsized role shaping Japan’s China policies.11 \\n\\nFirst, the Abe government has signaled that it wants to use the fortieth anniversary of \\nthe Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship as an opportunity to put the bilateral \\nrelationship on a more stable footing. The two governments have not minimized the \\nsignificant obstacles to a genuine sea change in their relationship – the territorial \\ndispute and broader competition in the East China Sea, Japanese concerns about \\nChina’s support for North Korea, and tensions regarding China’s burgeoning military \\npower – but have agreed that bilateral dialogue with a view towards building a stable \\nrelationship is worthwhile. As 2017’s joint statements recognized, economic cooperation \\nwill be an important factor for restoring trust between the two countries. The expectation \\nis that the commitment to stabilizing the bilateral relationship will lead to an exchange of \\nhigh-level visits, including visits by Xi and Li to Japan and Abe to China and the drafting \\nof a new bilateral communiqué that would highlight the importance of bilateral economic \\ncooperation, particularly through the BRI.  \\n\\nPublic opinion polls suggest that the Japanese public is broadly supportive of efforts to \\nstrengthen bilateral cooperation. The annual survey of public opinion in Japan and \\nChina conducted by Japanese think tank Genron NPO found that while sources of \\ndistrust remain, especially the dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, the Japanese \\npublic is increasingly less pessimistic about the state of the relationship at present and \\nless pessimistic about the future of the relationship. 12  The 2017 poll, which was \\nreleased in December, suggests that Abe can count on domestic political support for \\nreaching out to Beijing. The poll found: \\n\\n• 59.2% of Japanese believe “a new, stronger cooperating relationship should\\nbe established between the two countries for the sake of a stable and\\npeaceful order”;\\n\\n• 40.7% of Japanese believe that “[strengthening] trust between the two\\ngovernments” would be useful for improving the relationship;\\n\\n• The share of respondents who identified China as a country that poses a\\nmilitary threat to Japan fell from 66.6% in 2016 to 45.3% in 2017.\\n\\nThe perception that China is less threatening to Japan and that it is important for the \\ntwo governments to work together stands in stark contrast to the years following the \\n2010 collision between Japanese Coast Guard and Chinese fishing vessels near the \\ndisputed islands and the 2012 standoff following Japan’s “nationalization” of the islands, \\nafter which Japanese public hostility to China rose sharply.  \\n\\nHowever, while the public is more open to bilateral cooperation, the Genron NPO poll \\nshows that the Japanese public is also highly skeptical about the prospects for \\neconomic cooperation. Only 27% of respondents (9.7% strongly, 17.3% relatively) \\n\\n167Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nagreed that the two economies’ complement each other, “making it possible to build a \\nwin-win relationship.” A plurality – 35.9% - expects that economic relations will worsen \\n(although this was an improvement over 2016 when 44.2% were pessimistic). Only \\n8.6% said Japan should cooperate with China’s economic plans; a large majority \\n(61.4%) was not sure. The implication is that while the public is supportive of diplomatic \\nmeasures to reduce tensions and strengthen cooperation, the Japanese people are not \\nnecessarily clamoring for Japan to follow China’s economic leadership. Whether \\nintentionally or not, the Abe government’s approach appears to fall at this sweet spot. \\nFor the same reason, the Japanese government’s approach could be highly sensitive to \\nincidents in the East China Sea, such as the recent passage of a Chinese submarine \\njust outside territorial waters near the disputed islands, which prompted protests from \\nthe Japanese government.13 \\n\\nAt the same time that the Abe government is sensitive to the opportunities and \\nconstraints presented by changing public attitudes towards China, it is also sensitive to \\nthe Japanese business community’s interest not just in a stable relationship but in the \\nbusiness opportunities arising from the BRI. It is not clear just how widespread interest \\nin the BRI is among Japanese firms: a May 2017 Reuters survey found that 95% had no \\ndesire to participate in the BRI and no firms were currently considering participation in \\nBRI projects.14 However, it is entirely possible that business sentiment changed once \\nthe Abe government signaled that Japanese participation (with public financing) was \\npossible. One indicator of corporate Japan’s enthusiasm is advocacy in favor of BRI \\nparticipation by the leadership of Keidanren, Japan’s leading business federation. \\nKeidanren chairman Sadayuki Sakakibara attended the Belt and Road Forum at \\nBeijing’s invitation; approved of references to BRI cooperation in the 2017 Abe-Xi joint \\nstatements, noting that Japanese businesses were especially interested in “connectivity \\ninfrastructure” projects;15 and led a business delegation to China in November during \\nwhich he argued that bilateral cooperation through the BRI would benefit not just the \\ntwo countries but the whole world.16 Meanwhile, the joint statement produced by the \\nKeidanren-hosted Japan-China CEO Summit in December included a BRI plank that \\nstated: “Both sides agreed to work closely with each other in close cooperation in third-\\ncountry markets in which both countries’ companies can demonstrate their superiority \\nwithin the ‘One Belt, One Road’ framework.”17 (In his remarks at a reception for the \\nsummit, Abe noted that Sino-Japanese cooperation on infrastructure could “contribute \\ngreatly to the prosperity of Asian peoples” and suggested the possibility of cooperation \\nas part of the BRI, but also said such cooperation would be under Japan’s “Free and \\nOpen Indo-Pacific Strategy” framework.18)  \\n\\nAt a basic level, Keidanren’s support for Japanese participation likely reflects concerns \\nthat by foregoing participation, Japanese firms – which have already been engaged in a \\nfierce competition with Chinese firms for infrastructure projects across the region – \\nwould be operating at a disadvantage in the race to build the infrastructure Asia’s \\nmiddle-income countries need to develop. Corporate Japan’s concerns likely include not \\nonly the advantages that Chinese firms could enjoy but also firms from other economic \\nrivals, including South Korea, Germany, and France, which have signaled their \\nwillingness to cooperate with China through the BRI. Corporate Japan’s influence \\n\\n168Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nshould not be overstated: its voice carries weight in government deliberations, but it \\ndoes not necessarily make the government’s policies. Nevertheless, in this case, given \\nthe Abe administration’s focus on creating new market opportunities for Japanese firms \\noverseas and promoting Japanese exports, including infrastructure, the administration \\nwas likely receptive to corporate Japan’s arguments that if Japan remained outside of \\nthe BRI, Japanese firms would miss profitable opportunities. However, it is too early to \\nsay how many Japanese companies will participate in the BRI, in what countries and on \\nwhat projects they will work, and just how profitable participation will be. \\n\\nJapan’s regional development strategy\\n\\nAs Abe’s aforementioned remarks at the Japan-China CEO Summit suggest, Japan’s \\nparticipation in the BRI will occur within the existing framework of Japan’s regional \\ndevelopment, trade, and investment strategies. Japan has contributed to the \\ndevelopment of Southeast and South Asian countries since the early 1950s, beginning \\nwith reparations during the early postwar period and continuing to significant amounts of \\nofficial development assistance (ODA) and investment as Japan’s economy achieved \\ntakeoff growth. In a broad sense, Japan’s postwar approach to ODA and investment in \\nAsia’s developing countries anticipated what China is trying to accomplish through the \\nBRI. The Japanese government recognized that by investing in the industrialization of \\nAsia’s less-developed countries – particularly through energy infrastructure and \\n“connectivity” infrastructure like roads and ports – it could create overseas market \\nopportunities for Japanese firms and exports, strengthen Japan’s political influence in \\nstrategically important countries, and secure access to energy supplies and other \\nresources needed for Japanese producers.19 \\n\\nWhile over time Japan has directed more resources to poverty alleviation in least-\\ndeveloped countries, its development strategy has remained preoccupied with the \\neconomic development of Southeast and South Asia. For example, in 2015, Japan’s \\ntotal gross ODA disbursements were roughly USD 12bn, approximately half of which \\nwent to Asia – including USD 3.2bn to Southeast Asia and USD 2.46bn to South Asia. \\nRevealingly, the two largest recipients of Japanese ODA were India and Vietnam, which \\nreceived USD 1.54bn and USD 1.42bn in ODA respectively. Both countries are, of \\ncourse, increasingly important strategic partners for Japan and targets for Japanese \\nforeign direct investment as they become integrated in Japanese supply chains.20 \\n\\nHowever, as China has grown wealthier and began using its resources to promote \\neconomic development through infrastructure construction in Asia and elsewhere in the \\ndeveloping world, Japan has found itself locked in a competition with China to win \\nprojects, preserve market share, and maintain political influence across Southeast Asia \\nafter decades of being the region’s preeminent economic power.21 As a result, the Abe \\nadministration has upgraded its approach to regional development in order to preserve \\na leadership role for Japan even in the face of what has been described as China’s \\n“Marshall Plan” for the twenty-first century. At the same time, as the Abe government \\narticulated Abenomics, its program for revitalizing Japan’s economy, it identified \\ninfrastructure exports as a source for potential growth, meaning that competition with \\n\\n169Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChina and Asia’s “infrastructure gap” presented Japan with a major opportunity. \\nTherefore, in March 2013, the administration created a prime ministerial advisory \\ncouncil to develop a strategy for infrastructure exports and develop new tools for \\nproviding public support for Japanese exporters. The government established a target \\nof JPY 30tn in orders for infrastructure exports by 2020, three times larger than the JPY \\n10tn Japan exported in 2010. Abe and other senior officials have persistently used \\nforeign trips to promote Japan’s infrastructure systems, especially high-speed rail and \\nsubway and electrical systems (including nuclear power). \\n\\nAs the Abe government developed this approach, it recognized that Japan would not be \\nable to match China in quantitative terms and has therefore articulated a regional \\ndevelopment strategy focused on “quality.” The February 2015 revision of Japan’s \\nDevelopment Cooperation charter stresses the need for “quality growth” that is \\ninclusive, sustainable, and resilient.22 In Asia, this would entail “both physical and non-\\nphysical infrastructure including that which is needed for strengthening connectivity and \\nthe reduction of disparities both within the region and within individual countries,” with a \\nfocus on helping Southeast Asian countries escape the “middle-income trap.” Several \\nmonths later, in May 2015, Abe announced the creation of the Partnership for Quality \\nInfrastructure as part of the broader overhaul of Japan’s development policy. Japan \\nwould increase its investment in Asian infrastructure to JPY 13.2tn between 2016 and \\n2020, a 30% increase over the previous five-year period, with the funds divided \\nbetween the ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Japan \\nBank for International Cooperation’s (JBIC) infrastructure investment program, the \\nJapan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corporation for Transport & Urban \\nDevelopment (JOIN). To encourage private investment, JBIC would relax its conditions \\nrequiring host governments to offer guarantees of their ability to repay loans and instead \\noffer to cover losses incurred by private investors. JICA would streamline the process of \\ndispensing loans and grants and would work closely with the ADB to foster public-\\nprivate partnerships (PPP). JICA and the ADB would establish a fund to enable them to \\nmake equity investments in support of infrastructure investment. Recognizing that Asia’s \\ninfrastructure needs are substantial, he argued, “We should seek ‘quality as well as \\nquantity.’  Pursuing both ambitiously is perfectly suited to Asia.”23 This program was \\nclearly intended as Japan’s response to the then-nascent BRI and AIIB. \\n\\nThe Abe government would further refine its infrastructure export strategy in 2016, when, \\nin conjunction with its hosting of the G7 in May 2016, it unveiled the “High-Quality \\nInfrastructure Export Expansion Initiative,” which included new capital for Japan’s public \\nfinancial institutions that would, from 2017 onwards, increase annual support for \\ninfrastructure exports to JPY 200bn annually from JPY 110bn, sharply reduce the time \\nrequired to secure a yen-denominated international loan, explore euro-denominated \\nlending, and increase NEXI’s insurance coverage for overseas projects to 100%.24 \\n\\nSeen from this perspective, the pending decision to participate in the BRI appears to be \\nsimply a new component of a wider-reaching strategy rather than a new strategy in and \\nof itself. Limited participation in the BRI may present Japan with new opportunities for \\nboth meeting its development goals by helping to close Asia’s infrastructure gap and for \\n\\n170Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nmeeting its infrastructure export target. Indeed, even as Japan has moved closer to \\nembracing the BRI, it has deepened its partnership with India to promote its own \\ninfrastructure initiative, the AAGC. The Abe government has not only engaged India as \\na partner for advancing “quality” infrastructure in Asia and neighboring regions, it has \\nalso taken advantage of India’s decision to not join the BRI to ramp up its own \\ndevelopment assistance, complementing the broader strategic engagement between \\nthe Abe and Modi governments. The joint statement from Abe’s September 2017 visit to \\nIndia includes a laundry list of Japanese aid and investment projects in India, including \\ninfrastructure development in India’s North Eastern Region (which, coming in the wake \\nof the military confrontation between India and China at Doklam, was opposed by \\nChina25); major rail investments, including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail and \\na JICA-sponsored technical assistance program for the National High Speed Rail \\nCorporation; subway projects in six major cities; and energy, sanitation, and “smart city” \\ncooperation.26 As noted previously, as of 2015 India was already the largest recipient of \\nJapanese ODA, and the latest bilateral exchanges suggest that India will continue to \\ngrow as both a partner and recipient of public development assistance and private \\ninvestment from Japan. The deepening of the Japan-India partnership puts Japan’s \\napproach to the BRI in perspective. In much the same way Japan has pursued TPP as \\nan alternative vision for the regional trading regime, Japan has pursued its own vision of \\nregional development. Even if Japan seeks areas of cooperation with China, strategic \\ncompetition between the two countries will lead Japan to keep China-led initiatives at an \\narm’s length and will lead it to pursue its own vision for regional development even if it \\ncannot match China in terms of funding. \\n\\nComparison: Australia and the BRI\\n\\nJapan’s evolving approach to regional development and the BRI contrasts in important \\nways with Australia, another Asian developed country with a complex, interdependent \\neconomic relationship and an often-contentious political and security relationship with \\nChina. Like Japan, Australia recognizes Asia’s needs for infrastructure and has also \\nstressed the importance of “high-quality” infrastructure that “has robust social and \\nenvironmental safeguards and avoids unsustainable debt burdens on the economies of \\nthe region.”27 Unlike Japan, however, Australia has struggled to chart an independent \\npath that balances cooperation with China and pursuit of its own development strategy. \\nIt may belatedly be reaching a similar policy mix as Japan has articulated. \\n\\nTo a certain extent, however, Australia and Japan are moving in opposite directions. \\nWhereas Japan opposed the AIIB and refused to consider BRI participation before 2017, \\nAustralia concluded a free trade agreement with China in 2014, was a founding member \\nof the AIIB in 2015, and, according to Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye, entered \\ndiscussions with China in 2015 and 2016 regarding how China and Australia could \\ncooperate under the auspices of the BRI, including a possible linkage to Canberra’s \\nplan for developing Northern Australia. 28 However, ahead of a March 2017 visit to \\nAustralia by Premier Li Keqiang, the Turnbull government abandoned talks regarding a \\nmemorandum of understanding for a BRI-Northern Australia linkage.29 In short, even as \\nJapan was preparing to discuss how to cooperate with the BRI, Australia was rejecting \\n\\n171Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChinese overtures to extend the initiative to Australia itself. Australia has not \\ncategorically rejected the BRI; Trade Minister Steven Ciobo attended the Belt and Road \\nForum in May 2017, for example, on which occasion he said, “Australia supports the \\naims of initiatives such as Belt and Road that improve infrastructure development and \\nincrease investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.”30 \\n\\nAs with Japan, Australia’s approach to the BRI has been strongly shaped by domestic \\npolitics. In Australia’s case, despite signals from Canberra that it is willing to work with \\nChina on infrastructure investment across Asia, Australia has been in the midst of a \\n“panic” about the Chinese government’s influence in Australia following reports about \\n“thought policing” of Chinese students at Australian universities and the resignation of \\nopposition Senator Sam Dastyari after it emerged that he appeared to have accepted \\nChinese donations in exchange for defending Beijing’s positions, particularly on the \\nSouth China Sea.31 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull himself escalated tensions with \\nChina when, speaking in Mandarin, he evoked Mao Zedong by saying “the Australian \\npeople stand up” in response to perceived Chinese influence operations. 32  In this \\ncontext, it may be difficult for the Turnbull government to bolster cooperation with China \\non infrastructure investment or extending the BRI to Australia proper. In fact, since the \\nstart of 2018, Canberra has feuded with Beijing over its development policies after \\nMinister for International Development and the Pacific Concetta Fierravanti-Wells \\ncriticized China for funding “useless buildings” in the South Pacific,33 prompting the \\nChinese government to oppose Canberra’s “irresponsible remarks.”34 In this context, it \\nmay be difficult if not impossible for Australia to move beyond what Australian scholar \\nIan Hall calls Australia’s “wait-and-see” BRI strategy.35 \\n\\nAt the same time, Australia is struggling to articulate an independent development \\nstrategy. While it has enthusiastically embraced the TPP-11 alongside Japan, the \\nAustralian government has continued to cut ODA budgets and has yet to articulate new \\npolicies to leverage private-sector investment. This may be beginning to change: in \\nDecember the Turnbull government issued a report highlighting opportunities for \\ninfrastructure investment in the Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)36 and \\nthe revival of the “quad” of Australia, the US, Japan, and India could create new \\nopportunities for economic cooperation. Nevertheless, even as Japan has responded to \\nChina by revamping its development institutions, promoting private investment, and \\npursuing new relationships to promote regional development before seeking to \\ncooperate with the BRI, Australia has struggled, failing either to reach an \\naccommodation with the BRI or to develop a new strategy for competing with China. \\n\\nBy comparing how Japan and Australia have responded to the BRI, there are two \\ntakeaways. The first is that domestic politics matters. Part of the reason Japan is only \\nnow pursuing a role in the BRI is that the Japanese public is not nearly as hostile \\ntowards China as it was after the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute intensified after 2012. \\nSimilarly, the uptick in fear and hostility in Australia towards China’s presence in \\nAustralia has made it difficult for Canberra to take a consistent position towards the BRI. \\nSecond, although Japan has argued for “quality” infrastructure investment, it has \\nrecognized that it cannot counter China without spending some money. While Japan’s \\n\\n172Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nODA budget has not necessarily grown, as mentioned previously the Abe government \\nhas channeled more funds to its overseas investment institutions and made it easier for \\nthem to lend. By contrast, the recent spat between Australia and China over China’s aid \\nin the South Pacific has highlighted the extent to which Australia has cut its ODA \\nbudgets.37 \\n\\nImplications for the United States\\n\\nThe massive investment surge promised by the BRI has highlighted longstanding \\nconcerns about the risks of economic interdependence with China; with Chinese funds, \\nanalysts argue, will come Chinese influence over a recipient’s foreign and domestic \\npolicies. As the recent uproar in Australia shows, these concerns are not limited to \\ndeveloping countries – and they are not new concerns.38 \\n\\nHowever, Japan’s management of its relationship with China and its cautious embrace \\nof the BRI is instructive. While we do not yet know what form Japanese cooperation with \\nthe BRI will eventually take or what effects it could have on Japan domestically, the Abe \\ngovernment’s approach offers some lessons. \\n\\nFirst, the Japanese government’s shift on the BRI rests on an essential fact. With the \\nBRI added to the Chinese Communist Party’s constitution at the nineteenth Party \\nCongress, there is no question that the BRI will remain central to China’s foreign policy \\nfor at least as long as Xi is in charge. Whether or not third countries decide to cooperate \\nwith China through the BRI, China will continue to use it to strengthen its trade and \\ninvestment links across Eurasia and the rest of the developing world. Developed \\ncountries like Japan and Australia have the choice to stay out of the initiative – and are \\nobviously less dependent on Chinese investment than the less developed and \\ndeveloping countries most in need of infrastructure – but staying out will have costs, \\nwhether in terms of lost opportunities for one’s businesses or lost influence in BRI \\npartner countries. \\n\\nIf the BRI will be a fixture in Asia’s economics and politics, the developed democracies, \\nespecially the maritime democracies in Asia, need to have their own plans for how to \\npromote development in Asia, particularly in the middle-income countries of ASEAN. As \\nimportant as strengthening security ties with allies and partners around East Asia is for \\nthe United States, Japan, and Australia, security cooperation will not be sufficient to win \\n“hearts and minds” in the region over the long term. Obviously, China’s rise is divisive \\nthroughout the region and countries can be attracted to China’s economic power while \\nstill being concerned about its military power. In fact, for many of China’s neighbors its \\neconomic power is a source of anxiety too. In a 2017 Pew survey of attitudes towards \\nChina across the region, only 26% of Vietnamese, 49% of Indonesians, 48% of Filipinos, \\nand 20% of Indians said that China’s growing economy was a good thing for their \\ncountry. Ironically, Australians were the most positive about the benefits of China’s \\ngrowth: 70% said it was good for Australia. In all of these countries, majorities (and a \\nplurality in Indonesia) said China’s growing military power was a bad for their \\ncountries.39 These attitudes present an opportunity to the US and its allies to present an \\n\\n173Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nalternative vision for the region. But, over time, as China ramps up its investment \\nthrough BRI, it could wield influence through a variety of channels, complicating efforts \\nby the US and its allies to win support for their own initiatives in the region.40 As the US \\ncompetes for influence in Asia, it cannot assume that fears of China’s military power will \\nbe sufficient to preserve its influence. As Japan has shown, the best way for the US and \\nits partners to challenge China’s growing influence is to offer an alternative. As Japan’s \\nengagement in India has shown, by committing resources and pursuing its own \\ndevelopment strategy, Japan has lowered the costs to India of staying out of the BRI. \\nPerhaps India will not be able to stay out of the BRI forever, but Japan’s ODA and \\ngrowing investment portfolio will increase India’s freedom of action if and when it does. \\nThe same holds true in other countries on China’s periphery. Their fears of dependence \\non China give the US and its allies an opening, but as Japan shows, it is necessary to \\nhave something tangible to offer them. \\n\\nThis need is even more profound now that the US has withdrawn from TPP and the \\nadministration has not yet articulated a new strategy to deepen engagement with \\nmiddle-income Asia. As noted previously, TPP offered Asia’s developing countries new \\nmarket opportunities in the US in exchange for reforming their economies in ways that \\nbenefited US companies. As the Obama administration emphasized and as the Abe \\nadministration has continued to stress, TPP also provided the region with an alternative \\nsets of rules that could force China to adapt, instead of pushing its own version of the \\nrules governing trade and investment in Asia through the BRI. While Japan’s bid to \\nrevive TPP may preserve some of its benefits as an alternative vision for regional \\neconomic integration, the absence of the US limits its attractiveness to the developing \\ncountries that were otherwise eager to join. Without a regional trade strategy aimed at \\nmiddle-income Asia, it is imperative for the US to develop a regional development \\nstrategy that uses bilateral foreign aid, cooperation with the ADB and other multilateral \\nlending institutions, and, perhaps most importantly, incentives to encourage private \\ninfrastructure investment in South and Southeast Asia. Given Japan’s existing \\ncapabilities and influence, the US should coordinate closely with Japan and follow \\nTokyo’s lead in stressing the importance of high-quality infrastructure. Developing a joint \\nregional development strategy could be an appropriate agenda item for the US-Japan \\nEconomic Dialogue, as well as for future meetings of the quad. \\n\\nDespite China’s determination to use its wealth to promote greater economic ties to \\nChina across Eurasia and expand its power and influence, it is not inevitable that China \\nwill succeed in binding its neighbors ever closer. But the US and its allies cannot beat \\nsomething with nothing. If they want to support the development of Asia and ensure \\nthat, even as the region develops, its growth is fiscally, environmentally, and socially \\nsustainable, it is imperative that they coordinate and develop their own plans for \\nmeeting Asia’s developmental needs, giving the countries of South and Southeast Asia \\nmore freedom of action even as Chinese investment proceeds.  \\n\\n174Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Michael Camdessus, “Why China’s belt and road must be a pathway to sustainable development,” \\nSouth China Morning Post, 17 May 2017. <http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-\\nopinion/article/2094611/why-chinas-belt-and-road-must-be-pathway-sustainable>. \\n2 Jiji Press, 24 December 2017. <https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2017122400239>.

Thank you all. \\nI\\'m glad I had lunch; right?  It\\'s got us revved up.  Whoo.  Yes.  So to my fellow \\n\\ncommissioners, first hearing from Commissioner Stivers, please. \\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Sure.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you all for \\n\\nthose excellent testimonies. \\nLet\\'s, if we could, start with South Asia and India.  As you mentioned, you know, \\n\\nChina didn\\'t invent connectivity.  It\\'s been going on for a long time, and there\\'s been numerous \\ninitiatives to connect especially South Asia, which is one of the least connected regions of the \\nworld.  I mean India is not even connected to itself, much less its neighbors in South Asia, much \\nless to Afghanistan, and much less to Central Asia. \\n\\nAnd there\\'s been numerous initiatives to try to improve connectivity from India\\'s \\nstandpoint and kind of get Afghanistan, in particular, and Central Asia better access to the \\nmarkets in both Pakistan and India, and that was a major initiative of the last administration, \\nwhich was called the New Silk Road before China called it the New Silk Road. \\n\\nBut my question is this: should the U.S. be going down that road in terms of \\nhelping India better connect to South Asia?  And is that a competition for what the Chinese are \\ndoing in terms of connecting to everywhere pretty much?  And how receptive is India to that?  \\nHow much are they doing?  And how can we help India? \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Sure.  So I mean I think, as you point out, because there is such a \\nsignificant deficit already there in terms of connectivity, I think there is really significant \\ncapacity to pursue complementary initiatives in the region that don\\'t just function as competition.  \\nThe needs are very significant as you point out.  A number of them are--there\\'s even more needs \\ninside India itself.  A lot of the Japanese initiatives are internal to India. \\n\\nThere\\'s significant deficits there.  So I mean I think it\\'s possible to do this in a \\nmanner that doesn\\'t, isn\\'t wasteful, doesn\\'t simply heighten the geopolitical competition with \\nChina and the region if it\\'s pursued effectively. \\n\\nI mean I think the Japanese model is still, to me, the kind of gold standard on all \\nof this in several respects.  There\\'s real money behind it.  It\\'s got significant private sector \\ninvolvement and buy-in.  It\\'s differentiated clearly--the Quality Infrastructure Initiative.  \\n\\nIt dovetails very closely with the political agenda that India has in the region.  But \\nit also involves a kind of conditional offer of partnership with China on very specific terms that \\nhave just been laid out before, just in December, in terms of the sorts of projects that Japan is \\nwilling to work with China on under the BRI. \\n\\nSo I think that\\'s the kind of zone that one has to get into.  And, of course, the \\nother thing is there\\'s a serious trade agenda there, and that\\'s a piece where, of course, India lags \\nin terms of its own enthusiasm for involvement in high-standard trade agreements and things like \\nthat. \\n\\nAnd I think that is an area where it would be helpful if India could be drawn in \\nmore effectively to those sorts of frameworks that Japan has been pushing very effectively in the \\nlast period of time. \\n\\nSo I think those would be the main areas. Some of them are internal.  Some of \\nthem are some of the Southeast Asia connectivity.  A lot of these are kind of East-West where \\nsome of the China pieces are North-South.  Some of it is being able to develop non-China-centric \\nmodels.  India has a number of plans, including again cooperation with some of the Southeast \\n\\n177\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nAsian states, with Japan and others, and finally I mean one of the biggest problems remains the \\nIndia-Pakistan piece on this when it comes to transit trade in the region, access to Afghanistan.  \\n\\nIt\\'s possible to construct things around it, and Chabahar and these things have.  \\nBut in the end being able to ensure that there is an environment in South Asia where rivals are \\nalso able to trade and benefit from economic linkages with each other will be helpful, and I think \\nin the end that\\'s something that the U.S. will also have to play a role in facilitating and has tried \\nto, of course, in the past. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  I mean it just seems to me connectivity is not a \\nzero-sum game. \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Exactly. \\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  I mean you have, you know, Belt and Road \\n\\nInitiative.  It\\'s going to move forward.  No one is going to stop it.  It\\'s going to do what it\\'s going \\nto do.  But a robust India connectivity initiative could, you know, obviously do a lot for the \\neconomies in the region, and whether Japan will lead that or whether the Quad can come \\ntogether and work on that sort of thing. \\n\\nBut it would be a balance for the region in terms of connectivity to two of the \\nlargest markets that might make more sense in terms of stability and prosperity for the region.  \\n\\nJust real quick to Asian Development Bank. Asian Development Bank has been \\nthe multilateral institution.  They do projects in China, in India, all over Asia.  That would seem \\nto me, it would seem to me that the ADB is the institution that is kind of being relegated to the \\nsecond choice based on all these bilateral development initiatives. \\n\\nAnd I guess my question is what is Japan\\'s view of the ADB?  I mean from my \\nperspective, it looks like it\\'s being supplanted, and what can we do to strengthen the role of \\nADB?  What can the U.S. do in particular? \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  So I think, I think Japan has found itself in an uncomfortable \\nposition certainly when AIIB came on the scene, and one of the questions was how do we protect \\nthis institution that\\'s been kind of our, you know, we\\'ve led, we\\'ve supported?  It\\'s been one of \\nour vehicles for pursuing development in the region.  I mean but Japan itself has always pursued \\nbilateral development assistance as well. \\n\\nSo the ADB is certainly part of the portfolio.  And, look, at this point, it\\'s \\ncertainly in a better position I think to fund a lot of these projects than the AIIB.  The bank itself \\nhas, I think, indicated that it is fully willing to work with the AIIB.  Look, they, you know, ten \\nyears ago identified the infrastructure gap that middle-income Asia was going to face that needed \\nto be filled.  So there--I mean they\\'re obviously at a place where they can lend and support high-\\nquality infrastructure in a way that the AIIB is not ready to do yet. \\n\\nSo I mean I don\\'t think there\\'s quite as much concern at this point about whether \\nit\\'s being sidelined.  I mean I think there is so much out there that needs to be funded that I mean \\nthey\\'re--they\\'re at the table.  Japan, I think, upped its amount.  One of its initiatives over the last \\nseveral years is increasing its funding with ADB. \\n\\nSo I don\\'t think there\\'s a worry necessarily about it being supplanted.  You know, \\nI think making sure that the United States continues to meet its commitments, the ADB is \\nimportant, and, you know, supporting that emphasis on high-quality infrastructure is a way to \\nmake sure that this alternate vision, I think, continues to move forward and really becomes \\nreality.  So I think that really just making sure the U.S. is an active participant in the ADB is \\nessential. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Just one quick follow-up.  Have you seen any \\n\\n178\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nlessening of standards by the ADB in order to--I worry about a race to the bottom in terms of \\nstandards in Asia because of the Belt and Road Initiative.  Have you seen any of that, Mr. Harris \\nor Mr. Eisenman, Dr. Eisenman? \\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  Well, I was just going to associate myself with these remarks.  \\nIt seems to me that there\\'s enough to go around when it comes to infrastructure construction, and \\nthat in a lot of ways the ADB is setting the standard, and it can set high standards, as Mr. Small \\nsaid a moment ago. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s in setting those high standards that it can, in fact, in fact, benefit maybe \\nfrom the competition with the AIIB, right, that the AIIB is competing with it and thus making it \\nraise its standards in order to--and raise the amount of funds. \\n\\nSo it\\'s got more funds and higher standards in a way that is actually facilitating \\nand enhancing it through competition.  So I don\\'t--I agree with the initial statement you made.  I \\ndon\\'t see it as a zero-sum game.  And the AIIB, to my understanding, hasn\\'t really done anything \\nyet. \\n\\nSo having done almost nothing and being in Beijing, and Beijing, to my \\nunderstanding, and, friends, you can tell me if I\\'m wrong, is the AIIB the only institution in \\nBeijing that\\'s not controlled by the Communist Party of China and is not a foreign embassy; \\nright? \\n\\nSo it\\'s physically in a tough location politically, if that makes sense; right?  \\nWhereas, the ADB doesn\\'t face this kind of problem.  So I\\'m not sure that that is hampering it or \\nif other issues are hampering it, but it\\'s certainly the general environment with which the \\norganization exists. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Thank you. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Okay.  Senator Talent, please. \\nCOMMISSIONER TALENT:  Thank you. \\nMr. Small, I\\'m very interested in your discussion of India.  You said that the \\n\\nChinese took care with the Japanese and the Russians to lay the basis for all of this and didn\\'t \\nwith India. \\n\\nAnd then you said India was successful, I think if I understood you correctly, in \\nimposing some red lines in South Asia.  So could you and the others please chime in?  Flesh that \\nout a little bit.  Why do you think the Chinese didn\\'t prepare the ground with India?  What\\'s the \\nsignificance in terms of what it says about Chinese-Indian competition?  And how was India able \\nto impose those red lines, as you put it? \\n\\nAnd then anybody else who wants to chime in on that. \\nMR. SMALL:  Thank you, Senator.  \\nSo the first element of this was, of course, China has a much better relationship \\n\\nwith Russia than it has with India.  There are other tensions there, but I don\\'t think that was \\nactually the nub of it.  I think the nub of it was that China has not been ready, and I think it may \\nnow be prompted to take account in a serious way of India\\'s sense of South Asia being its \\nbackyard, and that I think what India has showed in the last period of time, partly with the red \\nlines which we can go into, partly with what played out on the border, is that China is going to \\nhave to negotiate terms with India, that India has the capacity to influence China\\'s-- \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER TALENT:  So if I could jump in, do you think they thought \\nthat the Indians would just give way?  They didn\\'t think that they would effectively stand up for \\ntheir interests? \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  I think they thought they\\'ve been able to make a lot of the \\n\\n179\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nadvances that they\\'ve made in the last period of time without very much resistance, and then they \\nmoved ahead with some of these initiatives with Pakistan, that they felt they\\'d been able to kind \\nof shift some parameters there.  There were things that they used to be careful about.  They were \\nquite careful about Gwadar.  They were quite careful about the kinds of investments they had. \\n\\nAnd then they really started amping it up with CPEC, and they kind of tried--they \\nactually tried to pursue a slightly de-hyphenated approach to the two countries.  It doesn\\'t work \\nin the region.  The Chinese relationship with Pakistan is something that India sees in various \\nways as a critical security concern, and they just didn\\'t do--that they hadn\\'t done economically \\nwith Pakistan what they had been doing before.  India--they went to the Indians and said, oh, this \\nwill be helpful to you.  This will stabilize Pakistan.  This will deal with de-radicalization things.  \\nIndia completely understandably sees the relationship through a security prism and wasn\\'t buying \\nit. \\n\\nAnd I mean some describe China as having strategic contempt for India.  They \\ndon\\'t take its concerns seriously enough.  I think what\\'s played out in the last couple of years has \\nbeen a significant corrective to that.  India has political influence, it has military influence, even \\nif it doesn\\'t have the same resources that it can bring to bear financially and economically. \\n\\nThe two cases that I mentioned, and I mean you could see the same thing with the \\nMaldives.  You could see, I mean India, even if it doesn\\'t do a dollar for dollar matching can \\nshape these countries\\' choices, and I think China understands that better.  And the countries in \\nthe region understand that better. \\n\\nI very much doubt there will be another dual-use port for China in South Asia.  I \\nthink they will have their run of the Pakistani ports.  I don\\'t think they\\'ll have a dedicated naval \\nbase or something.  I don\\'t think elsewhere in the region they will, they will end up with that \\noption because I think India will prevent it. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER TALENT:  Well, I just find that very interesting, and the \\nothers may want to come in, because it suggests that where there\\'s an effective push back that the \\nChinese will substantively change their methods and perhaps their objectives, which might be a \\nclue for American policy. \\n\\nDoes anybody else want to chime in? \\nDR. EISENMAN:  I was just going to agree with what you said, Senator.  So in \\n\\nthe Chinese strategic thinking, and much has been written about this, there\\'s a concept called the \\n\"shi,\" or the propensity of things; right?  And so if the propensity of things is in your favor, then \\nyou take a particular policy, it\\'s likely to be successful.  But if the propensity of things is against \\nyou, even the best thought-out plan is not likely to be successful. \\n\\nSo I think that that\\'s exactly right.  You know, the Chinese, the sense of it is very \\nopportunistic.  And so where you find push back, then you move around that push back.  And so \\nto that extent, you can, as a foreign power, benefit from that understanding, but it requires clearly \\ndefining your interests; right?   \\n\\nMy friend, Ambassador Derek Mitchell, has an analogy he likes to think about in \\nterms of basketball.  When you\\'re standing and somebody hits you, the foul is on them.  When \\nyour feet are moving and you\\'re all over the place, the foul is on you. \\n\\nAnd so to the extent that we can have a policy that\\'s clear, I think that that\\'s \\nperhaps the most important thing of all is that our policy is clear and supportive of our allies.  \\n\\nYou know this, this road that the CPEC corridor, it\\'s going through this territory \\nwhich is claimed by India; right?  So it seems that, you know, I don\\'t whether it\\'s a strategic \\ncontempt or just contempt or just not thinking it through, but it seems that if you\\'re going to drive \\n\\n180\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nthe road through territory that India claims--whether it\\'s theirs or not, I\\'m not even getting into \\nthat--it seems like you\\'re almost precluding them from participation; right? \\n\\nThey\\'d almost have to change their national policy of territorial integrity to join \\nyour One Belt One Road.  So I don\\'t know if it\\'s through contempt, neglect, or maybe purposeful \\nexclusion; right?  Or I don\\'t know.  Maybe the geography means you can only drive it through \\nthat area.  But it seems to me that the minute you go through that contested area, you make it \\nimpossible for India to really be an important participant. \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  So I think one thing to add, and I wonder if Beijing was taken \\naback, the extent to which Abe and Modi have cemented a development partnership, you know?  \\nYou look at the wish, you know, the laundry list of projects that Japan and India agreed on when \\nPrime Minister Abe went to India in September, and it was, you know, he went to Prime Minister \\nModi\\'s home province and was, you know, a giant celebration. \\n\\nI mean it was this lengthy list of not just, not just, you know, the big ticket \\nprojects about the high-speed rail corridor and the subways. I mean you obviously have those big \\nprojects.  But so much of what they\\'re doing now is how do you get Japanese companies that are \\nnow increasingly diversifying their locations in Asia, and, you know, for the last, for the better \\npart of this decade, you\\'ve heard about the China Plus One.  Well, now, India, I think, is on the \\nradar screen for a lot of Japanese companies provided that you can get some of this infrastructure \\nand connectivity in place because I think right now a lot of them look at it and say, you know, \\nmaybe, but we need, you know, we need to actually be able to use this. \\n\\nAnd so you look at that laundry list, and so much of it is how do we get Japanese \\nmoney here? How do we get Japanese companies as partners?  And, you know, a lot of that is \\njust Japanese, you know, these public financial institutions providing sort of the floor to help the \\nJapanese companies enter the market.  I mean, but it\\'s a slam dunk.  I mean you look at how \\nmuch Japan has leaped on this opportunity, and you wonder if that is pushback in its own way, \\nthat, okay, Japan saw the opportunity and has leveraged the relationship that Abe has with Modi, \\nand Abe has a longstanding interest in India, and they\\'re running with it. \\n\\nAnd that I think now, you know, certainly is wrong for China, and I think that\\'s \\ngot to be a factor as well. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\nCommissioner Shea, please. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Sure.  Well, thank you very much. \\nI guess my first question is for Mr. Small and then I have a question for Dr. \\n\\nEisenman.  I\\'m sorry, Mr. Harris.  Maybe I\\'ll come up with one later. \\n[Laughter.] \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  But for Mr. Small, one of the things we learned \\n\\nthis morning or heard this morning was that China has learned as a result of its significant global \\ninvestments maybe to localize security.  So my understanding is that in Pakistan, China is relying \\non a 12,000 strong Pakistan security force.  Part of the projects go, are in Balochistan, which is a \\nvery tenuous area of Pakistan. \\n\\nI was wondering if you could just give us a briefing on how the security, the local \\nsecurities is doing there? \\n\\nAnd then, Dr. Eisenman, another thing I thought the Chinese learned from their \\nglobal investments was that they can\\'t just bring in all this labor, Chinese labor.  They have to \\nsort of integrate local workers into their projects. \\n\\nBut then you said that one of their objectives is to deploy their--of the Belt and \\n\\n181\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nRoad Initiative--is to deploy their excess labor.  So I was wondering if you could, if you could \\nflesh that point out a little bit?  And what, do they have a number associated with their excess \\nlabor?  We have, you know, 30 million excess laborers that we need to deploy?  I mean what, if \\nthere is such a number, I\\'d be curious to hear that.  \\n\\nMr. Small. \\nMR. SMALL:  So thank you, commissioner. \\nYou\\'re correct in China has the Pakistani army or its kind of inter-services \\n\\nprotection force that\\'s been put in place.  The numbers could go substantially higher even than \\n12,000.  It\\'s basically just guided by the scale of the projects that are there. \\n\\nThere\\'s a Maritime Protection Task Force as well operating in the vicinity of \\nGwadar.  Basically mobile.  And this is added to a lot of the protection measures that have been \\nput in place after some of the incidents that took place back in 2007, 2008, around that sort of \\ntime. \\n\\nThey\\'ve actually done a relatively good job of securing Chinese personnel since \\nthat time. There was a period of time in which there were a number of kidnappings, killings of \\nChinese workers. In the period since then with these sort of stronger protection measures that \\nhave been put in place, you haven\\'t--you\\'ve had near misses in Karachi.  You\\'ve had the kind of \\nbombing incident and things.  You haven\\'t had Chinese workers working on these kind of \\ndedicated projects kidnapped or killed. \\n\\nThere is a current potential exception.  There was an engineer that disappeared in \\nKahuta, which could be the first kidnapping case, which should be rather sensitive. \\n\\nThe interesting thing is the greater concern is actually not the protection afforded \\nto the projects themselves.  It\\'s the other Chinese that are coming into the country as a result of \\nthis and are operating outside this protection umbrella.  The case of the missionaries that were \\nkilled, kidnapped and killed in Quetta, for instance, and all of the incidents, in fact, that have \\ntaken place.  An academic, a cyclist that was riding through Pakistan to try to go to Iran and got \\npicked up. \\n\\nThe biggest headache is actually as much all of these other personnel who are \\nfloating around the country, and I think that\\'s actually some of these countries, including \\nPakistan, can put in place really elaborate protocols.  I mean people can be transported in \\narmored personnel carriers to projects and things, but some of these softer targets are going to be \\na bigger headache. \\n\\nThere is an influx of Chinese personnel coming to these countries, and it still, of \\ncourse, causes a significant tension between the governments when it comes to recovery efforts \\nfor kidnapped victims and all of these sorts of cases. But I think more of them will come from \\nthose cases than successful attacks on projects themselves where I think the Pakistanis have \\nactually done a relatively successful job.  There are Pakistanis who have been killed but not \\nChinese.   \\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  Well, thanks for an excellent question.   \\nBefore I get into it, I have a quick question.  How many, the CPEC corridor, do \\n\\nyou happen to know the percentage of Chinese versus Pakistani labor working on it?  Andrew?  \\nOkay.  Because my understanding is there is a significant contingent of Chinese as well working \\non it. \\n\\nSo a couple of points to this very important question.  One is in terms of total \\nexcess labor, we know China has about 30 million extra men, which is about the entire \\npopulation of Canada, and it has to find a way to employ these people; right?  Otherwise they \\n\\n182\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nbecome a stability risk. \\nAnd so the exact number of people that they\\'re looking for jobs for, I don\\'t know.  \\n\\nBut I know that it\\'s in the millions.  And I know that this is in part the result of their one-child \\npolicy and other measures that they\\'ve taken for many decades. \\n\\nNow as I had mentioned during my oral testimony, BRI is at this point anyway \\nlargely domestic, and that means that employing these people within China is perfectly \\nlegitimate as long as they\\'re employed and not causing social stability problems. \\n\\nSo in Henan Province where you--or Hunan Province--excuse me--where you \\nmay have had a slowdown of construction, now you\\'ve got more money going in, which means \\nmore people are being hired, which means that your concerns about unemployment within that \\nprovince are reduced. \\n\\nSo the labor issue doesn\\'t necessarily have to be about bringing them outside of \\nthe country.  It can also through the BRI Initiative be done within the country.   \\n\\nIn terms of the external, I think the commissioner is correct, that there has been \\nsome push back in terms of having Chinese labor on the ground.  However, I would say in my \\ninvestigation from the book I worked on with Ambassador David Shinn on China, Africa, we \\nfound that local labor laws have a lot to do with what China does and does not do in particular \\ncountries, and this is not all that surprising. \\n\\nBut we found, for instance, in Sudan at the time where we did research that it was \\nvery hard to fire a worker.  And therefore the Chinese were more than happy to bring in their \\nown workers because if they hired Sudanese workers and fired them, they\\'d have to pay them \\nback pay, and it was a whole mess. \\n\\nBut in Ethiopia, you could hire and fire a worker three times a day.  There was \\nvery little limitation, and so they used the Ethiopian workers like tissues, to some degree; right?  \\nIf they didn\\'t like one, they would move on and they\\'d hire another.  And so the local labor laws \\nhad a lot to do with this. \\n\\nIn other countries we were in, people would show us forms that say, see, we have \\nexactly to the man the right amount of Chinese labor, and by the way, here\\'s my new Hummer; \\nright? \\n\\n[Laughter.] \\nDR. EISENMAN:  So it was a little questionable as to whether or not the law of \\n\\nthe country was being implemented.  I don\\'t have any proof to say it wasn\\'t except for the fact \\nthat it didn\\'t feel right that it went to the person of the amount of Chinese labor. \\n\\nBut so I would say this is a question that has a lot to do with where the project is \\nbeing implemented.  If it\\'s implemented within China, of course China labor is going to be used \\nentirely.  If it\\'s outside of China, we have to look at the laws of that country and their ability to \\nimplement them. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Thank you, sir. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Thank you. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Okay.  Vice Chairman Bartholomew, please. \\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Thank you very much.   \\nAndrew, I just wanted to add one thing as you were talking about India, which is \\n\\ndemography, and that sort of as you look five, ten, 15 years down the road, 50 percent of India\\'s \\npopulation is under the age of 25.  We know that China has demographic aging issues that \\nthey\\'re going to deal with. \\n\\n183\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nSo I think factoring that into India\\'s rise or India\\'s ability to sustain itself in the \\nregion and beyond, I think is going to be an important thing.  You know that.  I just--we\\'ll chalk \\nit up to the flu. \\n\\n[Laughter.] \\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  I just want to ask all of you the \\n\\nquestion, one of the questions that I asked earlier, which is from Beijing\\'s perspective, what do \\nyou think constitutes success for BRI?  What are the markers do you think that they are looking \\nto to be able to decide that this is a successful initiative? \\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  Well, um--sorry, do you want to go? \\nMR. HARRIS:  No, go ahead. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  So as I said in my oral testimony, I would say that the BRI \\n\\nInitiative in order to be successful probably has four components.  One is economic.  Another is \\npolitical, cultural, and then strategic.  \\n\\nEconomics.  First, I mean deploying the excess capital, the excess labor, and then, \\nyou know, probably being repaid; right?  At the end of the day, these are loans, and if they\\'re not \\nrepaid, it\\'s hard to see the program as a success. Now, you could go and write off all these \\nloans, but at that point, the question would be why did you make them loans in the first place, \\nright, if they were going to be a giveaway? \\n\\nSo presumably you want to either get repaid or you want to get equity stakes for \\nyour loans.  Internationalization of the renminbi has been something that\\'s been an ongoing \\npriority for Beijing, and then, as I said, politically you\\'ve got to be liked better at the end of the \\nday; right?  If you go through all of these troubles, all of this money, and at the end of the day \\nyou lose influence in these countries, it\\'s hard to call it success.   \\n\\nAnd then strategically, building China as a metropole, as an essential part of \\nglobalization. All roads leading to China to some degree.  And enhancing China\\'s role as a \\nleading country in the world, a major power, both in a reputational sense and an economic sense \\nand political influence sense. \\n\\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Mr. Harris. \\nMR. HARRIS:  I mean I would just add to that I think there\\'s a key word that \\n\\nunderlies a lot of that, and that is legitimacy.  And I think that explains a lot of the dance between \\nBeijing and Tokyo now to find the terms that Tokyo might contribute in some way.  I think it \\nmight explain how China courted Australia quite intensively within the last several years to try to \\nget Australian buy-in and maybe even to have Chinese or Australian infrastructure projects as \\npart of the BRI, particularly in northern Australia. \\n\\nHaving Japan, having Australia say yes, this is a legitimate approach to \\naddressing a real Asian and global problem, this infrastructure gap, and just the challenge of \\ndevelopment, and Japan recognizes it, Australia recognizes it, and I think the creation of the \\nAIIB showed a similar pursuit of legitimacy, the courtship of developed countries and getting \\nthem to sign on and getting European countries and South Korea, and Japan, and trying to get all \\nthese countries to say, yes, China is putting a real serious answer to a problem that we all \\nrecognize and we recognize the solutions to it and we support it. \\n\\nI mean that, I think, is a major concern, and I think it underlies beyond getting a \\nreturn, beyond just the cold calculations of political influence.  I mean I think there is you\\'re \\nrecognizing China\\'s status, you know, that it has risen, it is now providing, you know, true \\nleadership in a concrete--literally a concrete sort of way.  And I think that\\'s a big part of it. \\n\\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Andrew. \\n\\n184\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Yes, just to add to that, I mean in the first phase, they had a real \\nproblem.  There weren\\'t projects happening.  You had this great initiative and you didn\\'t have \\nthings moving forward on the ground.  When you look at the early contours, and this is why I \\nhighlighted the Pakistan case in the way that I did, governments that were willing to shovel \\nprojects to the Chinese, allow the Chinese to come in on the kinds of terms for their companies \\nthat they want in a significant way, established a relatively privileged position and political \\nsalience that they might not otherwise have had. \\n\\nInitially I think they just wanted something to show for it, and so--and the second \\nelement in the very early phase was a kind of political consent.  It does actually matter to China \\nthat India didn\\'t turn up to the forum.  They pushed really hard and they sent endless arrays of \\ndiplomats.  The ambassador in India still comes up with suggestions for renaming CPEC and \\nthings that get expunged from the record and things like that.  \\n\\nThey do actually want this to be acquiesced to by countries, and I think one of the \\npriorities through this first phase was buy-in just at the political level.  I think they consider \\nwhere they\\'ve got to with Russia a success.  I think they consider what\\'s happened with Japan in \\nthe last period a success.  \\n\\nI think in some cases even if it\\'s just nonresistance, that\\'s okay.  I think in India\\'s \\ncase they just wanted acquiescence to CPEC and things like that.  But I think that partly, in the \\nfirst phase, those were partly what they wanted.  I would just note, as well, I mean I would agree \\nwith everything that my fellow panelists have mentioned on this. \\n\\nThere are some very ambitious country specific objectives over the very long-\\nterm.  I mean again I look at what constitutes success in Pakistan.  There\\'s this enormous array of \\nkind of stabilizing the country, building confidence, adjusting the mindset, deradicalization, \\nbuilding it as an economic hub.  The incentives for the various actors actually in the Chinese \\nsystem on this are not all the same, and so what constitutes success for some of the economic \\nactors in Pakistan is not necessarily the same as what constitutes success for the PLA. \\n\\nYou\\'re going to come into collision at certain points when it comes to questions \\nlike do you write off debts to your friends as a sort of strategic example to other countries that \\nthere are benefits to being a close security partner?  Do you--and Pakistan is going to be I think a \\ncase study for this as well. \\n\\nThe banks, the financing institutions, will then run into moral hazard questions \\nand things like that.  There will be others at the political level who have different incentives.  At \\nthe moment, a lot of these objectives are aligned under this kind of amorphous glob of all of the \\nkind of BRI stuff.  There are going to be points, and I think you already see this in some \\ncountries, where what constitutes success starts to be differentiated and comes into collision. \\n\\nI don\\'t think they\\'ve really worked out how to navigate that fully yet.  At the \\nmoment, it\\'s just I think the overall political direction is there, and then people are just swinging \\nin.  Having been watching the Pakistan relationship for a long time, you suddenly have all these \\nnew actors come in with different interests who had never been involved before when it was just \\nthe PLA running the show and other powerful actors.  You know it\\'s going to be difficult to \\nbreak ties between some of these groups. \\n\\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  So I\\'m curious--this was kind of raised \\nalso--your point about legitimacy--Nadège Rolland, of course, today talked about tributary states.  \\nOh, she\\'s here.  But talked about tributary states.  I\\'m inclined, actually, frankly, I\\'m perhaps a \\nlittle bit more cynical than some other people in it.  It\\'s a concept that I find makes perfect sense \\nwhen you look sort of at China\\'s rise and displacing the United States and all of that. \\n\\n185\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nAnd so I find myself wondering how much, how much is legitimacy an issue or \\nhow much is just sort of sheer power politics?  I could put the word \"fear\" out there, but power \\npolitics.  So getting respect and being treated as a legitimate power is a little bit different than \\nknowing that you can throw your weight around if and when you need to in order to accomplish \\nwhat you think you want to be accomplishing. \\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  I would actually say that these two things come together quite \\nnicely; right? The tributary state system is a way to legitimize at that point the imperial \\ngovernment of China.  You kowtow to the emperor; you bring him your shabby gifts, and he \\ngives you silk and jade, and then that legitimizes the grandeur of the throne and the imperial \\nregime. \\n\\nAnd I was a part of an event in Kashgar not too long ago.  Not Kashgar--excuse \\nme--in Urumqi not too long ago which seemed neo-imperial in that sense; right?  Foreigners \\ncoming up one after another explaining why the BRI was going to save them, and the Chinese \\nsitting in their big red chairs, \"um, yes, yes.\"  So it did have this neo-imperial approach to it. \\n\\nBut I would also agree that legitimacy is part of the need for a neo-imperial \\napproach; right?  That these things are very much interwoven and connected in terms of \\nlegitimizing the government of China internationally; right?  The more countries that \\nacknowledge China, and this is the Taiwan issue as well, it\\'s a legitimization of the Communist \\nParty\\'s rule over China. \\n\\nThe more countries that show up to the BRI, the more that legitimize their \\ndevelopment- first approach, the more that accept their political rule.  So I would say that both \\nare right and actually very much overlapping of what you both said. \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  I mean I think just too, I mean I think legitimacy is important, and \\nI think we see it in precisely the cautiousness with which Japan has approached.  Because I think \\nif it were just about power politics, I mean I think Japan would say we want nothing to do with \\nthis, there\\'s nothing for us to gain here, and I think, I think they\\'ve recognized that there is a \\ncertain amount of leverage that comes from saying, you know, Japan is out or Japan is in.  You \\nknow, Japan is a wealthy country.  Japan did this.  You know, in some ways China is following \\nJapan\\'s footsteps in a lot of ways. \\n\\nJapan spent several decades after the war as it rebuilt, trying to build political \\ninfluence through connectivity, through building infrastructure, through creating opportunities \\nfor its companies.  I mean this is, in some ways this is a blueprint.  China is following a blueprint \\nthat Japan invented.  I mean obviously on a bigger scale, but this is something that Japan spent a \\nlot of decades doing.  \\n\\nAnd so I think, you know, probably Beijing, Beijing might be reluctant to admit \\nit, but, you know, getting Japan\\'s kind of blessing in some capacity I think is actually important, \\nand also, you know, that it\\'s an important U.S. ally, and so kind of prying, you know, even if it\\'s, \\neven if Japan is finding its own uses for it, I think prying Japan away and saying, look, Japan \\nsaid this is okay, and it\\'s allowing its companies to participate and it\\'s putting its money in, that \\nmeans something beyond just simply we\\'re bringing Japan into our orbit. \\n\\nBecause I don\\'t think that\\'s actually what\\'s happening, but I think that Japan\\'s \\ncurrency is something different.  And, you know, that, so that\\'s precisely the kind of series of \\ninteractions at very senior levels over the course of 2017 where getting one line into a joint \\nstatement, where you look at the language kind of evolve between from July to November to \\nDecember, that you have these statements where Japan is sort of giving inch by inch, you know, \\ntrying to set, to say we\\'re not, we\\'re going to do this on our terms.  We\\'re not just going to give \\n\\n186\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nyou want you want, and I think there it reinforces the extent to which legitimacy is important if \\nnot the only thing. \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  I think it\\'s partly a decision that they will really have to make in \\nthe next period of time as to the relative priorities in this respect. \\n\\nI think they have tried to do everything together and have not, have, you know, \\nthey had debt-for-equity deals, looked for dual-use ports, given contracts on terms that are not \\nparticularly generous, not been transparent.  I mean they\\'ve looked to fulfil all of their objectives \\nsimultaneously, and I think they are running into legitimacy problems in some of these cases, \\nand they are in some cases running into certain forms of resistance.  And they don\\'t want--as in \\nother fields as well--kind of, as it were, countervailing coalitions that will work against them and \\nundermine their efforts. \\n\\nSo I mean in some of the cases, it\\'s just a practical response to what\\'s going on.  I \\ndo think this was, as they envisaged it, the more kind of benign version of what they were doing, \\na soft way to advance their power position and interests over time in ways that countries would \\naccept.  I think they were surprised by the reaction of countries like India actually, as well.  I \\nthink this is one of the other reasons that they, that they kind of had some of these missteps.  \\n\\nI think they thought that money would talk and people would want to see the \\nbenefits of investment from China and things like that.  I think the reconceptualization of what\\'s \\ngoing on for a lot of countries in rethinking what the economic ramifications are of certain kinds \\nof relationships with China is putting them in a trickier spot.  And if they make certain \\nadjustments in the next period of time, then there\\'s a different sort of impact. \\n\\nI mean the AIIB, again, in Chinese context, the AIIB is the sort of gold standard \\nversion of what they\\'ve been doing with this in terms of relative degrees of transparency, \\nmultilateral complementarity with existing initiatives.  But they don\\'t want the whole initiative to \\nlook like the AIIB.  They want to retain the prerogatives to do things bilaterally, do politically \\ntargeted efforts. \\n\\nBut they, in some of the cases, they\\'re going to have to make some choices as to \\nwhat contours the initiative takes.  I think they got away in the first phase with a degree of \\nconfusion about the intentions and things.  In the next period of time, more and more projects \\nwill hit the ground, there will be more and more cases where you can actually assess multiple \\ninstances of things like debt renegotiations.   \\n\\nIs Hambantota a one-off, they\\'ve learned, seen as a kind of cautionary tale, or is \\nthis something that they start to replicate in other cases?  If it is, it\\'s going to change the kinds of \\nresponses that countries have to it.  I don\\'t think they\\'ve reached a decision yet.  I think there\\'s \\nstill a lot of having cake and eating it with Belt and Road at the moment.  But I think it\\'s going to \\nbe forced on them soon. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Okay.  I have got questions for Mr. Harris and \\nDr. Eisenman at the moment.  And first let me start with Japan.  I want to dig deeper into this.  I \\nwas delighted to read your testimony, and I was reminded, and as you laid out the facts of the \\namount of investment Japan has and some of the frameworks that they have, I was reminded of \\nour trip this last year to Thailand and to Myanmar where it was really clear what role Japan is \\nplaying in parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia. \\n\\nIn your testimony, Mr. Harris, you spoke about two things I\\'d like you to expand \\non.  First of all, you mentioned Japan and India announced the creation of Asia-Africa Growth \\nCorridor, and I\\'m wondering if you can expand on that. \\n\\nAnd then on the next page, page or two later, you spoke about Japan\\'s free and \\n\\n187\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nopen Indo-Pacific strategy framework.  So could you give us for the record more details on both \\nof those?  And is Japan somewhat purposefully trying to play a little, not below the radar, but, \\nyou know, are they being wise to be not too confronting so that would be for you, Mr. Harris? \\n\\nAnd Dr. Eisenman, in your testimony, you spoke about, on page 14, that BRI \\nwould open new opportunities for fraud and corruption, and that many of these countries, which \\nwe all obviously know are rated poorly on corruption and transparency indexes.  Can you \\ncomment on the risks that you see for China in terms of money laundering and how that might be \\na factor as they--you mentioned how much debt, but, you know, it just seems like there are some \\nother risks? \\n\\nSo let\\'s start with Mr. Harris, please. \\nMR. HARRIS:  Thank you for those questions and for closely reading my written \\n\\ntestimony.  I appreciate that. \\nSo on the first, I mean I think at this point, the Asia and Africa Growth Corridor \\n\\nwas announced as a vision in May of last year, and so we\\'re looking at it.  It\\'s not even a year old.  \\nI don\\'t think they\\'re at a point now that they\\'re not, they\\'re not starting on projects yet.  I think \\nthere\\'s an idea, though, that it would rival some of the maritime dimensions of the BRI.  So that \\nit\\'s connectivity between India, particularly I think--and this is something that I think got China \\nrather upset--that Japan is focusing particularly on India\\'s northeast.   \\n\\nAnd I think the idea would be connectivity between northeastern India, Southeast \\nAsia, and then from Southeast Asia and the port structures in Southeast Asia, then build that out \\nto East Africa. And that really is the idea. \\n\\nBut I think they\\'re at the point now where it\\'s something they\\'ve laid out.  They\\'re \\ncommitted to it.  It obviously is part of this broader high-quality infrastructure approach.  But I \\nthink this is something that we\\'re going to have to watch going forward to see what actually this \\nends up looking like, what’s the timeline for getting these projects built. \\n\\nAnd I think really, as I\\'ve mentioned before, I think right now the main thing to \\nwatch between Japan and India is what Japan is doing within India, how Japan is filling India\\'s \\nneeds for infrastructure now. \\n\\nAs much as we\\'re seeing the cooperation in South and Southeast Asia more \\nbroadly, I think right now that Japan\\'s role in India itself is, I think, the more important \\ndimension of their cooperation right now. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Okay. \\nMR. HARRIS:  As for the free and open Indo-Pacific strategy concept, this is \\n\\nsomething that has existed basically in some form in Japanese foreign policy thinking for at least \\na decade.  When Abe was first prime minister, towards the end of first year as prime minister in \\n2006 and 2007, took a trip to India, gave a speech in the Indian Parliament where he talked about \\nthe meeting of the two seas, and this is something that I think has been close to him for, you \\nknow, to his thinking for a long time, this idea of, you know, India, enlisting India as a partner as \\nthe region changes, as China\\'s influence grows. \\n\\nAnd, you know, they would say that we\\'re not trying to contain China, you know-\\n- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\nMR. HARRIS:  They\\'re careful to say that that\\'s not the goal, but drawing India \\n\\ninto the East Asian balance of power is I think something Japan is very interested in.  I mean \\nobviously they look at demographics and see India is a country that could be important and could \\nbe helpful for Japan. \\n\\n188\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nAnd obviously then growing out of that was this concept of the Quadrilateral, and \\nso you had in 2007 the first convening of that, that body that basically then went dormant for the \\nbetter part of the last decade and only really was revived in November of last year on the \\nsidelines of APEC. \\n\\nAnd so that is, I think, a concept now that has been revived, but again it\\'s in \\nsearch of substance, you know, that, yes, military cooperation between Japan, Australia, India, \\nand the United States is, you know, there\\'s plenty of experience there and working together and \\nexercises, and that I think is going to proceed. \\n\\nBut I think there\\'s, it\\'s a concept in want of real practical goals that they can \\nachieve, and I think this focus on high-quality infrastructure and articulating an alternative vision \\nof infrastructure investment in the region is something that they could all work on.  And, you \\nknow, with Japan\\'s focus on it, with India getting in the game, Australia at least saying the right \\nthings if not quite getting there institutionally, there\\'s plenty of material to work with. \\n\\nAnd so I think as the administration is and the U.S. Congress thinks about how to \\ngive more substance to this Indo-Pacific concept, I mean I think infrastructure should be a \\npriority for that discussion going forward. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Are you aware of whether or not the United States is--some of \\nour key leaders are thinking about this in terms of the framework itself?  Hooking in with it or I \\nmean what\\'s the level of awareness here? \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  I think, I mean I think it\\'s, I think there are discussions.  I don\\'t \\nthink it\\'s at the level of, you know, formal strategy documents yet, but I think, certainly I think in \\nthe administration and various departments, I think there\\'s recognition that this is a--you know, \\nthis should be a priority, and that it could be done. \\n\\nAnd again the discussions, I think, in Congress about OPIC, OPIC going forward, \\nI think, are really important, having an institution that can contribute to these discussions, that\\'s \\ngoing to be the counterpart to JBIC and to JICA, you know, the Japanese institutions that have \\nbeen doing for so long. \\n\\nAnd I think there has to be a recognition here that Japan is so much more-- \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Right. \\nMR. HARRIS:  --experienced.  They\\'ve been doing this for so many decades.  \\n\\nYou know, they\\'re trusted.  I think the fact of going to Myanmar, going to Thailand, you know, \\nthat seeing the Japanese on the ground in all of these places in quite a substantial way and also, \\nyou know, the supply chains they have in all of these countries, you know, integrating these \\ncountries into Japan\\'s system of production, Japan is going to have an edge here.  And there\\'s no \\nreason why the United States can\\'t follow Japan\\'s lead and ask Japan, hey, what can we do to \\nhelp you?  You know, you\\'ve thought about this more, you have the resources, you have the \\nexperience; what can we do to support you? \\n\\nAnd I don\\'t think there\\'s any reason why the U.S. can\\'t be in a position to ask that, \\nto offer that support. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Good.  Thank you. \\nDr. Eisenman.  Thank you by the way. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Oh, no.  Thank you.  Thank you again for taking the time to \\n\\nread my written testimony which is pretty long. \\n[Laughter.] \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Thank you. \\nFirst of all, I want to associate myself with the remarks just made.  I was really \\n\\n189\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nhappy to see the Quadrilateral meeting for the first time in a decade.  I think it\\'s really essential \\nnot only on the economic side but on the political side; right? \\n\\nWe need the liberal leaders of the world to walk with their chests out a little bit.  \\nRight? Part of the problem is-- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  I like that. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  --we\\'re being a little too modest, right.  We\\'re not muscular \\n\\nliberals.  We\\'re the other side, right.  So I\\'m pleased to see this. I\\'d like to see a more political \\naspect to it, not just security, and of course economics as well, but owning, to some degree, \\ndemocracy and being proponents of it. \\n\\nIn terms of your question, which is a good one, this issue of corruption, and as \\nthis body knows and I\\'m sure everyone in the room knows, Xi Jinping has been leading this anti-\\ncorruption campaign, and this is a signature campaign as much, if not more so maybe, than his \\nBRI campaign, and so the idea that BRI could then contribute to an enhanced corruption seems \\nantithetical to his objective-- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Right, right. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  --in that way.  And so this is where the nexus of your question \\n\\nis and becomes very interesting.  If you\\'ve got two signature campaigns, and one is doing \\ndamage to the other, then that would seem to be a problem. \\n\\nAnd there is to some degree the internal component.  Maybe Xi Jinping can exert \\ninfluence, more influence, right.  This is within China so what\\'s going on in Hunan and other \\nplaces, it\\'s \"gue ne.\"  It\\'s internal and therefore China can to some degree utilize the tools of the \\nanti-corruption campaign.  That is these investigation squads, different internal Party \\nmechanisms to make sure that within China, the BRI is not or is less corrupt. \\n\\nBut externally when you\\'re in all of these myriad of different 60-plus legal \\nenvironments, linguistic environments, cultural environments, things become much more dicey, \\nand my experience is mainly on the Africa side, and so maybe I can recount a quick anecdote. \\n\\nAmbassador Shinn and I were doing research in Angola.  We met with a minister \\nin Angola, and there was a Chinese gentleman in the room so I began talking to him in \\nMandarin, and I asked him what he was doing, and he said, well, I\\'m building this particular \\nproject, but before I can do it, I need to build a villa for this minister, and he wasn\\'t pleased about \\nit, right?  That came out of his end, right?  And he rolled out the plans-- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Wow. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  --and showed me the bedrooms and everything.  But the point \\n\\nwas that it\\'s not necessarily that the Chinese are wanting to be corrupt; it\\'s to some degree the \\nenvironments that you work in when you work in the countries which have low transparency \\nindexes.  So I\\'m not trying to absolve anybody. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  No, I understand. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Yeah.  But it\\'s the nature to some degree of the environment, \\n\\nand the standard gauge railway in Kenya has come under a lot of criticism for the cost of the \\nendeavor.  And the question has been, and I don\\'t know the answer, is how much of that is \\ncorruption? \\n\\nNow it\\'s an expensive proposition to begin with, right?  The British lost a lot \\nbuilding their colonial railway.  But the question of whether or not corruption played a role in \\nthat is an issue as well.  And so again to go back to the answer to Commissioner Shea, a lot of \\nthis has to do with the local environments that they\\'re operating in, and whether the authority-- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Right. \\n\\n190\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  --or the state is significant enough to check that issue. \\nOn the other side, however, in China, traditionally, there has been a corrupt \\n\\nmentality in terms of doing business, and so I\\'ve heard, for example, one tale in an African \\ncountry where the Chinese received a criticism for an environmental degradation.  The \\nAmericans received the same.  The Chinese paid off that official and then the official was moved \\nand the paper came back onto their desk. \\n\\nThe Americans said, okay, well, we\\'ll pay you a percentage of it, and it went \\naway, and in the end, the Americans paid less to get rid of it, right?  So there is this kind of the \\nnature of doing business in China influences the way that Chinese businessmen behave abroad.  \\nThat shouldn\\'t be surprising.  That\\'s human nature. \\n\\nBut to the extent that China cleans up its act at home, we would expect to see, I \\nthink, less corruption abroad.  So the door can swing both ways.  If Xi is successful in his \\ncampaign, if he does wipe out corruption, we should expect to see less corruption in the BRI \\nInitiative than in past loans for infrastructure projects. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  I follow your logic, but I also think of the \\nvarious ports and the junctures and think about, I just worry about the terrorism, money-\\nlaundering piece.  Thank you. \\n\\nMr. Small, do you have comments on either the Japan conversation or on the \\nmoney laundering/terrorism component? \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Just to add really on the administration piece, where the current \\nU.S. administration is at, I mean I think the striking thing is the last time the Quad was \\nconvening, it was essentially a security-focused discussion. \\n\\nThis time when you had the assistant secretary-level meeting taking place, late \\nlast year, a large proportion of the discussions were precisely focused on the strategic economic \\nissues. \\n\\nNow, as I think Dr. Kliman flagged in the discussions this morning, is the Quad \\nthe natural structure through which to have those, to implement some of these things?  Not \\nnecessarily.  I mean I think there\\'s questions about whether that\\'s the natural grouping.  If you \\nlook at the kind of economic wherewithal that one can bring to bear on these issues, you may end \\nup looking at a slightly different constellation of countries that would be involved. \\n\\nIt\\'s a neat follow-through of countries that are located in the region, but I think the \\nEU is about to launch its Asia connectivity strategy and has substantial financial economic \\nresources to bring to bear there.  I think a lot of this will end up being done bilaterally with \\ncountries rather than some of these sometimes tricky plurilateral formats. \\n\\nI think you saw in the President\\'s trip to Japan as well some announcements of \\nnew forms of bilateral cooperation with Japan in this area.  I mean I think the adoption of the \\nlanguage around the free and open Indo-Pacific was in itself a very sort of significant recognition \\nof some of these prior efforts and thinking that was there on the Japanese side. \\n\\nAnd I mean I think this administration, the last administration, of course, had \\nimportant strategic economic priorities that it was pursuing, including TPP, but this \\nadministration is not.  But I do think this administration has been very seized with this question \\nof how to think about BRI and some of these issues in a way that I think in the end the previous \\nadministration sort of resolved not to come out with a position or a strategy on the issue. \\n\\nWhereas, I think now the free and open Indo-Pacific strategy, insofar as it\\'s there, \\nis moving into sort of implementation discussions and things.  I think a lot of this is very much \\ndriven by trying to address some of these strategic economic issues and specifically trying to do \\n\\n191\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nso with some of these partners--Japan preeminently but I think the Europeans as well, India, \\nKorea, Australia.  \\n\\nI mean I think there\\'s a lot of countries that are pretty like-minded when it comes \\nto these issues with a lot of assets to bring to bear on this.  And I think that\\'s going to be a very \\nimportant part of implementation. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  I\\'m reminded of conversations we just had this \\nweek amongst us about the importance of our allies and how we as we keep moving forward, \\nwe\\'re going to keep them high on our agenda for discussion. \\n\\nCommissioner Stivers, please. \\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Thank you.  Thank you.  A comment and a \\n\\nquestion.  A comment.  Thank you all for your recommendations.  I thought that your \\nrecommendation sections of your testimony were outstanding, especially on OPIC, Export-\\nImport Bank. \\n\\nI think we really need some, some very exact, specific recommendations for what \\nthe United States Congress can do and what the administration can do as opposed to just, you \\nknow, kind of lamenting and exploring what the Belt and Road Initiative is, which is a lot, and \\nthat\\'s important, but we have to think of some plans of action. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s important to remember, I think, that infrastructure is not the only driver \\nof economic growth.  And there are so many different things that we can do to promote growth, \\nand because China is doing it in this manner doesn\\'t always mean that we have to do it how \\nthey\\'re doing it or even in the sector that they\\'re doing it. \\n\\nWe have other strengths, and it\\'s important that we play to those strengths.  So \\nthat\\'s my comment and to thank you. \\n\\nBut a more specific question, something I\\'m a little bit worried about.  Mr. Harris, \\nyou mentioned that Japan is considering its role and kind of not sure where they are in terms of \\ntheir public role or their active role on the Belt and Road Initiative.   \\n\\nWhat, can you dive into that a little bit? What would that look like on the \\nextremes?  Like on the extreme if they wanted to go all in, would they participate in it?  Would \\nthey fund projects?  And on the other, what are the different--what does participation look like \\nfor things that Japan would consider?  Kind of an extreme and then kind of in the middle of \\nwhere you think they might go? \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  So I mean obviously one extreme is exactly where they\\'ve been \\nright up until now, which is they stay aloof, you know, they have their own strategy, they pursue \\ntheir own projects, they look at the region the way they have, and you know in the main that is \\nwhat they\\'re going to keep doing.  They\\'ve articulated their own approach.  They have their own \\nresources.  They have their own institutions. \\n\\nThat is going to be the dominant Japanese approach to the region going forward.  \\nI don\\'t think there\\'s any reason to think that that is going to change. \\n\\nObviously, the other extreme would be full government participation in some \\nform, and that doesn\\'t look like it\\'s on the table, and, in fact, actually one sign that Japan is not \\nactually trending that way, there was an expectation that when the Diet opened this week, and \\nPrime Minister Abe gave his speech to open the session laying out the government\\'s priorities for \\nthe next six months, that he was going to specifically refer to Japanese participation in Belt and \\nRoad as a priority for the government going forward, and he mentioned cooperating with China \\non infrastructure, but it was a much softer mention than I think had been anticipated and \\ncertainly the early news reports had suggested he would say. \\n\\n192\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nAnd so there\\'s definitely a cautiousness on the part of the Japanese government.  \\nYou know, I think part of this also is just they\\'re talking with Beijing about this, that there\\'s a lot \\nof negotiations.  Looking ahead to this year, this anniversary year, they want to do an exchange \\nof visits with Abe going to Beijing and potentially Xi Jinping coming to Tokyo either this year or \\nearly next year.  \\n\\nThey want to put out an additional communique.  They\\'ve had a series of \\ncommuniques in the last 40 years, and they want to put out a new one in which economic \\ncooperation, presumably through the BRI, would be one of the principles of the relationship.  But \\nI think getting, getting the form of that right, I think, is taking some time. \\n\\nAnd frankly I think Japan, the Japanese government I think is prepared to \\ndisappoint Japanese business in some ways where I think they\\'re much more enthusiastic about \\nbeing involved in projects and cooperating and seeing opportunities to export infrastructure.  I \\nthink the Japanese government really wants to ensure that this is part of the high-quality \\ninfrastructure approach. \\n\\nSo if they see opportunities to there are projects that meet their needs and check \\nthe boxes that they\\'ve laid out, I think they\\'ll pursue that and support that and use public \\nresources to back that.  But I think they\\'re going to be very selective.  I think it\\'s very much about \\nthe conditions in which cooperation would occur. \\n\\nAnd I don\\'t think there\\'s any--there\\'s not really any reason to think that Japan is \\ngoing to shift from that approach, that I think they would rather be out than go all in.  It\\'s either \\ngoing to be conditional participation or none at all.  And there is no reason to think that the Abe \\ngovernment is going to look differently. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Okay.  Thank you. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Well, thank you, gentlemen.  We appreciate \\n\\nyour testimony today, and that of all of all of our witnesses during today\\'s three panels.  The \\nCommission and guests have indeed been further steeped in Belt and Road, but you can count on \\nthe fact that we\\'re all going to have to keep monitoring it. \\n\\nAnd I\\'m grateful for Jonathan Hillman\\'s database so we can quickly at our \\nfingertips map it and see how it\\'s evolving. \\n\\nSo for today we stand adjourned, and I hope you\\'ll join us for our next hearing, \\nwhich will take place on February 15.   \\n\\nThank you. \\n[Whereupon, at 3:29 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.] \\n\\n193\\n\\n\\n\\tPresident Pro Tempore of the Senate, Washington, DC 20510\\n\\tSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515\\n\\tHearing on “China’s Belt and Road Initiative: Five Years Later”\\n\\n\\tBlank Page\\n\\tBlank Page\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

Shea and Katherine C. Tobin (Hearing Co-Chairs) presiding.\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER KATHERINE C. TOBIN \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Good morning, and welcome to the first hearing of the U.S.-\\nChina Economic and Security Review Commission's 2018 Annual Report cycle.  Thank you all \\nfor joining us, and those of you online as well. \\n\\nThe Commission has been following Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative since \\nits inception in 2013.  Since then, we have watched the initiative rise to the top of Beijing's \\nforeign policy agenda, evolving from a vague blueprint for regional connectivity to a well-\\nresourced, whole-of-government strategy. \\n\\nPresident Xi's signature foreign policy initiative is many things: an economic \\nstimulus plan; the global face of the \\\"China Dream\\\"; a marketing strategy; an upgrade of \\nBeijing's \\\"going out\\\" policy; a blueprint for economic dominance; and much more. \\n\\nIt's difficult to overstate the potential risks and rewards of the Belt and Road \\nInitiative, both for China and for partnering countries. \\n\\nChinese infrastructure projects have the potential to offload some of the excess \\nindustrial capacity currently weighing down China's economy.  If executed well, they could \\nprovide crucial economic opportunities for developing countries around the world.  They could \\nalso help burnish China's image as a responsible stakeholder and divert attention from more \\naggressive aspects of its foreign policy. \\n\\nOn the other hand, poorly-run projects that prioritize Chinese gains at the expense \\nof the host country's economy and citizenry would be no more than empty economic gestures \\nand could bring significant unpleasant reputational costs to Beijing. \\n\\nPerhaps more concerning, Chinese economic engagement could give way to \\ndangerously lopsided bilateral relationships and create opportunities for Beijing to employ \\ngreater economic coercion against smaller partner countries. \\n\\nSecurity risks abound as well.  For example, although the China-Pakistan \\nEconomic Corridor is arguably the most developed and promising component of the Belt and \\nRoad Initiative, Pakistan has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world for \\nChinese workers and citizens. \\n\\nDespite--or perhaps because of--the enormity of the Belt and Road Initiative, \\nsome U.S. policymakers, businesses and citizens have struggled to understand the breadth and \\ndepth of this effort.  So today we hope to shed light on the current status of the PRC's initiative \\n\\n66\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nand to consider whether and how it has the potential to reshape Eurasia and diminish our ability \\nto positively influence events in the Central, Southeast and South Asia area. \\n\\nTo our accomplished witnesses, thank you for being here to help us navigate this \\nvery important topic with us today.  I look forward to hearing from each of you.  \\n\\nI would also like to thank the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff for \\nsecuring this room for our use today, and now I will turn the floor over to my colleague and co-\\nchair, Commissioner Dennis Shea. \\n\\n77\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER KATHERINE C.

President Xi\\u2019s signature foreign policy initiative is many things: an economic \\nstimulus plan; the global face of the \\u201cChina Dream\\u201d; a marketing strategy; an upgrade of Beijing\\u2019s \\n\\u201cgoing out\\u201d policy; a blueprint for economic dominance; and much more. \\n \\nIt is difficult to overstate the potential risks and rewards of the Belt and Road Initiative\\u2014both for \\nChina and for partnering countries.  \\n \\nChinese infrastructure projects have the potential to offload some of the excess industrial capacity \\ncurrently weighing down China\\u2019s economy. If executed well, they could provide crucial economic \\nopportunities for developing countries around the world. They could also help burnish China\\u2019s \\nimage as a responsible stakeholder and divert attention from more aggressive aspects of its foreign \\npolicy. On the other hand, poorly-run projects that prioritize Chinese gains at the expense of the \\nhost country\\u2019s economy and citizenry would be no more than empty economic gestures, and could \\nbring significant unpleasant reputational costs to Beijing.  \\n \\nPerhaps more concerning, Chinese economic engagement could give way to dangerously lopsided \\nbilateral relationships and create opportunities for Beijing to employ greater economic coercion \\nagainst smaller partner countries.  \\n \\nSecurity risks abound as well. For example, although the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is \\narguably the most well-developed and promising component of the Belt and Road Initiative, \\nPakistan has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world for Chinese workers and \\ncitizens.  \\n \\nDespite\\u2014or perhaps because of\\u2014the enormity of the Belt and Road Initiative, some U.S. \\npolicymakers, businesses, and citizens have struggled to understand the breadth and depth of this \\neffort.  Today, we hope to shed light on the current status of the PRC\\u2019s initiative and to consider \\nwhether and how it has the potential to reshape Eurasia and diminish our ability to positively \\ninfluence events in Central, Southeast and South Asia. \\n \\nTo our accomplished witnesses, thank you for being here to navigate this very important topic with \\n\\n88\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nus today. I look forward to hearing from each of you. I would also like to thank the Senate Foreign \\nRelations Committee for securing this room for our use today. I will now turn the floor over to my \\ncolleague and co-chair for this hearing, Commissioner Dennis Shea. \\n\\n99\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER DENNIS C.

I think some of you may have traveled \\nfar and wide to join us.  So thank you.  And appreciate the time and effort you've put into your \\nexcellent testimonies. \\n\\nChina does not have a monopoly on plans to facilitate connectivity and trade \\nacross Eurasia and the Indian Ocean region.  During our hearing today, we will examine regional \\nreactions to China's Belt and Road Initiative as well as competing visions for regional \\nconnectivity, which have existed long before the Belt and Road Initiative. \\n\\nFor example, the United States launched the New Silk Road Initiative in 2011.  \\nToday, other regional powers, such as India and Japan, are actively promoting their own \\ninitiatives to bolster economic growth and infrastructure development.  These efforts present \\nopportunities for the United States to work with its allies and partners to provide complementary \\nor alternative options to China's Belt and Road. \\n\\nChinese leaders hope the Belt and Road Initiative will advance Beijing's \\ngeopolitical interests by improving ties with neighbors, securing supply routes, and expanding \\nChina's role in regional and global governance.  But deeper involvement abroad also comes with \\nrisks, including terrorism and instability, fractious local politics in partner countries, and great \\npower rivalry. \\n\\nIn response to these risks, the People's Liberation Army has accelerated its \\npreparations to protect growing Chinese interests overseas.  An increased PLA presence outside \\nof East Asia, driven by the Belt and Road Initiative, will create both geopolitical opportunities \\nand challenges for the United States and requires a thoughtful strategic response from \\nWashington. \\n\\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis recently said, and I quote, \\\"In a globalized \\nworld, there are many belts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of \\ndictating 'One Belt, One Road'\\\"--unquote. \\n\\nThe United States has a strong interest in maintaining a free and open Indo-\\nPacific region where international norms and standards are upheld and strengthened.

TOBIN \\n \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n Our first panel today will explore the economic drivers and implications of the \\nBelt and Road Initiative.  We are joined by a truly outstanding group of experts to discuss this \\nsubject. \\n We'll begin with Nad\\u00e8ge Rolland, Senior Fellow for Political and Security Affairs \\nat the National Bureau of Asian Research.   \\n Prior to joining the Bureau, Ms. Rolland spent two decades advising the French \\nMinistry of Defense on Asian and Chinese strategic issues.  She is the author of the 2017 book \\nChina's Eurasian Century: Political and Strategic Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative, \\nwhich I highly recommend for you to read.  It's compelling. \\n Ms. Rolland will provide testimony today on the economic and strategic drivers \\nand goals of the Initiative, and she'll describe how it has extended China's diplomatic reach and \\nits soft power. \\n Next we'll hear from Jonathan Hillman.  Mr. Hillman is a Fellow at the Center for \\nStrategic and International Studies where he holds the Simon Chair in Political Economy and is \\nthe director of the Reconnecting Asia Project.  And I want to give a shoutout to that because for \\nthose of us who like to see data or visuals, this website is a resource for anyone of us to use.  \\nThere's a map showing the probably hundreds, or more, projects that are underway as part of the \\nBelt and Road Initiative and the infrastructure projects.  But it also contains a database that \\nyou're going to be maintaining over time to catalog what's beginning, what's done, what's never \\ngot underway, et cetera. \\n So prior to joining CSIS, Mr. Hillman served as a policy advisor at the Office of \\nthe U.S. Trade Representative.  He will discuss emerging trends and the Belt Road Initiative's \\nimpact on China's trade and investment patterns. \\n We'll then hear from Randy Phillips.  Mr. Phillips is a Partner at the Mintz Group \\nand heads its Beijing office and many of its other Asian operations. \\n Mr. Phillips spent 28 years with the CIA, ultimately serving as the chief CIA \\nrepresentative in China.  He has also served as vice chairman of the American Chamber of \\nCommerce in China.   \\n Mr. Phillips will provide testimony on U.S. companies' participation in the Belt \\nand Road Initiative and identify the opportunities and the risks that U.S. companies face. \\n So let's begin, and I'd like to remind the witnesses to keep your remarks to seven \\nminutes and that will give us time for questions and answers. \\n Ms. Rolland, please begin. \\n \\n  \\n\\n1212\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF NAD\\u00c8GE ROLLAND, SENIOR FELLOW FOR \\nPOLITICAL AND SECURITY AFFAIRS, NATIONAL BUREAU OF ASIAN \\n\\nRESEARCH \\n\\nMS. ROLLAND:  Thank you very much, Commissioner Tobin, Commissioner Shea. \\nI'd like to start by thanking the Commission and its staff for inviting me to testify \\n\\nas part of today's hearing.  It's an honor to be here and a privilege to share this panel with \\nJonathan and Randal. \\n\\nIt would take a little bit more than the five minutes and 45 seconds that I now \\nhave to unwrap what Xi Jinping has himself called the \\\"project of the century.\\\"  As a matter of \\nfact, it took me over a couple of years of research to try to understand it and a couple of hundred \\npages to try to describe and explain it. \\n\\nSo I thought that today I would kindly invite you to refer to my written testimony \\nregarding what the Belt and Road Initiative is all about and what purposes it serves from \\nBeijing's perspective, and I would like to focus more specifically on a few questions raised by \\nthe Commission staff in preparation for this hearing, as well as on a few points I think might be \\nhelpful to keep in mind throughout the day as you listen to my distinguished colleagues' \\ntestimonies. \\n\\nSo I would like to make four main points. The first, BRI is not just about \\ninfrastructure.  Second, it's not just about economics.  Third, it's just beginning to take shape.  \\nAnd fourth, Beijing is deadly serious about it. \\n\\nSo let me elaborate on each of these points.  First, BRI is generally perceived as \\nan infrastructure project.  It's true, but it's not just that.  It's really a comprehensive vision for a \\nregional, political, economic and financial integration under Beijing's helm--a region that \\ncomprises two-thirds of the world's population and half of the world's current GDP.  And as \\nChina makes inroads in this vast region, it's inevitably going to reshape the region's economic \\nand strategic landscape. \\n\\nSecond, BRI is the Chinese leadership's answer to China's most pressing \\neconomic and strategic challenges.  It's not just about economic development.  It's also about \\nsocial stability.  It's about securing China's continental periphery. It's about energy security as \\nwell as broader political influence and strategic expansion.  So it's got many different layers. \\n\\nThird, regarding its progress to date, it's just beginning to take shape really.  There \\nis no official list of projects or countries involved. There is no official map.  The contours of BRI \\nappear very amorphous and flexible.  It includes older and new projects, some of which were \\nunderway before 2013 when Xi Jinping announced it, some of which are only partially funded by \\nChina.  All of this makes it very difficult to really pin it down. \\n\\nDifficulties have also emerged in several countries, most recently Pakistan, Nepal \\nand Bangladesh, but nobody, including China's strategic planners, expect it to go smoothly until \\n2049.  Beijing is very aware of the potential hurdles and is working hard to find solutions to \\novercome them. \\n\\nFourth, and my last point, one thing is clear: it's China's level of commitment to \\nmake it work.  BRI is Xi Jinping's baby, and if we believe that he is as powerful as worldwide \\nexperts say he is, there's a big chance that the rest of the Chinese system is doing everything it \\ncan to make it happen and succeed.  Or, at a minimum, that it bears fruit.   \\n\\nThe commitment that China is attaching to BRI has translated in several ways.  \\nIt's now written in the 19th Communist Party Charter, and thus it sets the overall direction for the \\n\\n1313\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nParty's agenda and efforts in years to come.  It's a long-term effort.  Beijing has mobilized a large \\narray of national resources to support BRI--political, financial, diplomatic, economic, \\nintellectual, et cetera--and the efforts are coordinated at the very top by a Leading Small Group \\nthat is staffed by Politburo members and on a day-to-day basis by the NDRC, the National \\nDevelopment Reform Commission. \\n\\nAll of China's major economic and development plans--the 13th Five-Year Plan, \\nthe Made in China 2025, the Internet Plus Strategy--all of them overlap and dovetail with Belt \\nand Road. \\n\\nAnd, yes, there's a certain degree of improvisation and flexibility in the way BRI \\nis unfolding, but these are just I think the characteristics of a system that works differently than \\nours and relies more on the propensity of things than on a step-by-step plan and program.  It does \\nnot mean that it is stupid or irrelevant. \\n\\nAs a conclusion, I would like to underline that BRI's intangible manifestations are \\nas important, if not more, than its actual physical development.  It is the multi-layered web of \\npolitical, economic, educational, industrial and security ties that China is developing with the \\ndeveloping world and that China is weaving right under our eyes that will shape tomorrow's \\nEurasian economic and geostrategic landscape. \\n\\nThe objective is an unrivaled Chinese influence over a key region of the world.  \\nThis is what really is at stake with Belt and Road.  This is what the Chinese regime is determined \\nto achieve, and this is why we need to take it very seriously. \\n\\nThank you very much for your attention. \\n\\n1414\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF NAD\\u00c8GE ROLLAND, SENIOR FELLOW FOR \\nPOLITICAL AND SECURITY AFFAIRS, NATIONAL BUREAU OF ASIAN \\n\\nRESEARCH \\n\\n1515\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \\nHearing on: \\u201cChina\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative: Five Years Later\\u201d \\n\\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\nNad\\u00e8ge Rolland \\nSenior Fellow, The National Bureau of Asian Research \\n\\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is generally understood as China\\u2019s plan to finance and build \\ninfrastructure projects across Eurasia. Infrastructure development is in fact only one of BRI\\u2019s \\nfive components which include strengthened regional political cooperation, unimpeded trade, \\nfinancial integration and people-to-people exchanges. Taken together, BRI\\u2019s different \\ncomponents serve Beijing\\u2019s vision for regional integration under its helm. It is a top-level \\ndesign for which the central government has mobilized the country\\u2019s political, diplomatic, \\nintellectual, economic and financial resources. It is mainly conceived as a response to the most \\npressing internal and external economic and strategic challenges faced by China, and as an \\ninstrument at the service of the PRC\\u2019s vision for itself as the uncontested leading power in the \\nregion in the coming decades. As such, it is a grand strategy1.  \\n\\n1. Belt and Road: What is It?\\n\\nThe Belt and Road Initiative was not announced as such five years ago, but in two separate \\nspeeches given by Xi Jinping: the first in Astana in September 2013, announcing China\\u2019s \\nwillingness to create a Silk Road Economic Belt stretching across land from China to Europe; \\nthe second in Jakarta in October 2013, mentioning China\\u2019s desire to launch its equivalent at \\nsea, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Both proposals rapidly got combined under the \\nabbreviation \\u201cOne Belt, One Road,\\u201d an English translation officially replaced in 2015 by \\u201cBelt \\nand Road Initiative\\u201d (BRI), supposedly to counter the impression that China owned the concept \\nand to reflect its willingness to welcome others\\u2019 participation. The basic idea is that \\ninfrastructure building (roads, railways, port facilities, pipelines, fiber optic and IT networks) \\nacross Eurasia will bring economic development to a large region spanning East to West from \\nChina\\u2019s eastern shores to Europe via Russia, Central Asia, South Asia and the Middle-East, and \\nfrom China\\u2019s southern shores to Southeast Asia, the Indian ocean rim, the Persian Gulf and the \\nMediterranean. This is a vast region mainly composed of emerging markets and rising middle \\nclasses and which, taken together, accounts for two thirds of the world population and over half \\nof the global GDP.  \\n\\nSince 2014, BRI has rapidly materialized through: \\n\\n\\u2022 promises of Chinese investments with amounts oscillating between $1 and 1.3 trillion\\ndollars, backed, among others, by the creation of new financial mechanisms such as the\\nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank (proposed in October 2013, officially opened in\\nJanuary 2016) and the Silk Road Fund (created in 2014);\\n\\n\\u2022 an intense high-level round of Chinese diplomatic engagement, supported by a forceful\\npropaganda campaign relayed by Chinese scholars and media around the globe, and\\ncrowned by the Belt and Road International Forum held in Beijing in May 2017;\\n\\n1 This testimony draws on the conclusions and research findings of my book, China\\u2019s Eurasian Century? \\nPolitical and Strategic Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative, NBR, 2017. \\n\\n16Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022 the successful initiation of an impressive array of projects extending across the\\ncontinental and maritime domain.\\n\\nSparing no modesty for a plan he personally designed with a handful of close advisors, Xi \\nJinping hailed BRI as the \\u201cproject of the Century.\\u201d If successful, BRI certainly has the potential \\nto fundamentally change the economic and strategic geography of the region. \\n\\n2. What Purpose Does It Serve?\\n\\nEven though BRI is officially portrayed and projected outside China as an economic endeavor \\nthat is meant for the benefit of the entire region, the internal discussions related to the project \\nreveal it is mostly intended to serve China\\u2019s interests and objectives, both in the economic and \\nstrategic domains.  \\n\\n\\u2022 On the economic side,\\n\\nBRI should be understood, at least partly, as a new stimulus package for the Chinese economy \\nwhose last double-digit growth was recorded in 2010. Right after the 2008 global financial \\ncrisis, the Chinese government quickly launched a $586 billion stimulus package, heavily \\ninvesting in domestic infrastructure projects in order to help sustain growth. This measure only \\nhad a short-lived positive effect. The government needed to find another solution to be able to \\nhit its self-imposed target of doubling GDP and per capita income between 2010 and 2020. \\nFrom the regime perspective though, a thorough transformation of the country\\u2019s economic \\ndevelopment model towards domestic consumption and private initiative would have come at \\nunacceptable political cost. Instead of veering towards such a transformation, the government \\ndecided to rely once again on its preferred model, stimulating growth through investment, \\nexports and subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), operating outside of China on a \\nregional scale, via BRI.  \\n\\nBuilding infrastructure across Eurasia would also have the double advantage of helping to get \\nrid of some of China\\u2019s excess industrial capacity that had been created by the 2008 stimulus \\npackage, while further supporting the state conglomerates\\u2019 \\u201cgoing global\\u201d strategy. Funded by \\nChinese policy banks (Eximbank, China Development Bank) and staffed by Chinese workers, \\nregional infrastructure projects would predominantly become the preserve of China\\u2019s SOEs \\n(China State Construction Engineering, China Railway Construction, State Grid, China \\nMerchants, etc.), opening new markets for them and helping them build and scale a truly global \\nfootprint. Finally, it was hoped that BRI would help increase regional e-commerce and cross-\\nborder transactions conducted in renminbi, thus accelerating the Chinese currency\\u2019s \\ninternationalization.  \\n\\n\\u2022 Beyond the supposed multiple economic gains BRI would bring to China, its architects\\nalso believe it will help reap substantial political and geostrategic benefits for their\\ncountry.\\n\\nFirst among these, and consistent with what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has tried to \\ndo for almost two decades albeit with uneven results, the hope is that more investment in \\nregional infrastructure will help reduce the development gap between China\\u2019s coastal and inner \\nprovinces. Sandwiched between its own eastern urbanized dynamic coastal poles, and emerging \\neconomies with increasing potential outside of its western and southern borders, China\\u2019s \\nlandlocked provinces lag behind in term of economic development. Development and enhanced \\n\\n17Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nliving standards are seen by Beijing as key factors to reduce the risk of social unrest and political \\ninstability. They are also seen as the best ways to discourage religious radicalization, \\nfundamentalism, and terrorist recruitment - both within China\\u2019s borders and beyond.  \\n\\nSecond, the acceleration of investments in infrastructure induced by BRI would enable Beijing \\nto tackle another of its recurrent anxieties, this time related to its energy security. For years, \\nBeijing has been uneasy at the thought that its energy imports transit through sea lanes of \\ncommunication that are under the protection and surveillance of the U.S. Navy including in the \\nSouth China Sea. Beijing has been looking for alternative routes to circumvent the so-called \\n\\u201cMalacca Strait dilemma\\u201d and diversify its supplies through land routes. The projected and \\ncurrent BRI projects illustrate an attempt to redraw the map of China\\u2019s energy supply routes \\nfrom Iran, the Gulf countries and eastern Africa, while increasing its imports from Russia and \\nCentral Asia. Traveling by sea/land pipelines through Pakistan and Myanmar, or directly by \\nland across Eurasia, some of China\\u2019s energy imports would thus bypass the South China Sea, \\nreducing the risk of being cut by a potential American naval blockade in case of a military \\nconflict.   \\n\\nLastly, China\\u2019s financial, political and diplomatic investment in BRI does not come out of a \\nheartfelt Chinese commitment to serve the common good. In return for its largess, China \\nexpects to get some concrete geopolitical benefits for itself. BRI\\u2019s architects are blurring the \\nlines between economy and strategy, and intend to use economic power as an instrument for \\nstrategic purposes.2 Instead of gunboat diplomacy and coercive military power, the PRC intends \\nto use BRI to access new markets, get a hold on to critical infrastructure assets, and influence \\nregional countries\\u2019 strategic decisions. Economic leverage will be used both as an incentive to \\ngarner support for its interests and reduce potential resistance, and as a means to punish \\nrecalcitrant countries.  \\n\\nBeijing expects that its plan will help \\u201cexpand its circle of friends\\u201d - in other words, strengthen \\nits influence in a vast area where democratic practice is weak, authoritarian regimes mostly \\nprevail, and where the US influence is rather limited. In this region, as in countries facing \\nincreasing waves of discontent against globalization, there is a real prospect that following the \\n\\u201cChina model\\u201d could become increasingly appealing. Liberal democratic ideals and standards \\nthat the U.S., together with its European and Asian allies, have been trying to promote over the \\nregion as part of their shared post-Cold War vision of an \\u201copen and free\\u201d Eurasian continent,3 \\nwill likely come under increasing threat as BRI\\u2019s standards (or lack thereof) spread across this \\nvast region.  \\n\\nUnder Xi Jinping, China has been increasingly vocal about its dissatisfaction with the current \\nworld order. During his 19th Party Congress speech last October, Xi presented China\\u2019s path as \\n\\u201ca new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while \\npreserving their independence.\\u201d4 Starting with the countries included along the Belt and Road \\nthat Xi purports to include in a \\u201ccommunity of common destiny,\\u201d the PRC now offers a recipe \\n\\n2 Professor Shi Yinhong calls this \\u201cstrategic economy.\\u201d See his paper, \\u201cChina\\u2019s Complicated Foreign Policy,\\u201d \\nECFR Commentary, March 31, 2015, \\nhttp://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_chinas_complicated_foreign_policy311562. \\n3 After the end of the Cold War, several Western countries tried to promote infrastructure interconnectivity and \\neconomic development in the hope that prosperity would transform post-Communist Eurasia into a democratized \\nand peaceful region. \\n4 \\u201cFull Text of Xi Jinping\\u2019s Report at the 19th CPC National Congress,\\u201d Xinhua, November 4, 2017, \\nhttp://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/19thcpcnationalcongress/2017-11/04/content_34115212.htm \\n\\n18Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nfor stability and prosperity, just like the one it has used for itself, and it is trying to convince \\nthe rest of the world that the Chinese way is the way of the future.  \\n\\n3. Internal Mobilization\\n\\nBRI is meant to improve both China\\u2019s economic situation and its security environment in order \\nto realize Xi Jinping\\u2019s \\u201cChina dream of the great rejuvenation of the nation.\\u201d It is the organizing \\nconcept of Xi\\u2019s vision for China as a rising global power with unique national characteristics. \\nIt sets the general long-term direction for China and seeks to mobilize and coordinate the use \\nof all available national resources (political, economic, diplomatic, military and ideological) to \\npursue internal (economic development, social stability) and external (foreign policy, national \\nsecurity) objectives in an integrated way. As such, it is a grand strategy that is meant to serve \\nChina\\u2019s unimpeded rise to great power status. \\n\\nBecause there exists no official map, no detailed publicly available list of projects, priorities, \\nplans or even targeted countries, no Belt and Road \\u201cnational task force,\\u201d no Belt and Road \\n\\u201cspecial representative\\u201d or general secretary, some observers have dismissed BRI as empty talk. \\nBut a closer look at the inner workings of the Chinese system reveals a high degree of vertical \\ncoordination for the initiative domestically. Such a mobilization effort reflects the priority \\nattached to it by the central government.

Five Years Later: Is It Real?\\n\\nEven more difficult to find than a detailed BRI plan laid out by Beijing, is a list of projects that \\nhave actually come to life since 2013. During the May 2017 Belt and Road Forum, the Chinese \\ngovernment published a \\u201clist of deliverables\\u201d purporting to show that over 270 \\u201cconcrete \\nresults\\u201d had been achieved in each of the five BRI areas, but mostly listing MoUs and \\ncooperation documents signed with the UN, national governments, and relevant agencies within \\nBelt and Road countries.11 Some Chinese governmental sources have pointed out that about 50 \\nSOEs \\u201chave invested or participated in nearly 1,700 projects in countries along the new Silk \\nRoad routes over the past three years.\\u201d12 It is nevertheless a challenge to pin them down, partly \\nbecause some of these projects were discussed, decided upon and/or were underway before \\n2013 (for example, Gwadar started in 2002, Hambantota in 2008), others have been announced \\nwith MoUs signed and promises of investment made, but have not yet sprung from the ground. \\nSometimes, the amounts of investment promised do not add up or China seems to have been \\npromising the same amount several times over the years. Some projects have been started by \\nother countries but funded either partially or totally by China, or have been announced by China \\nbut funded partially by non-Chinese financial institutions (such as ERDB, ADB and the World \\nBank). Should these also be counted as Belt and Road projects?  \\n\\nBRI is a work in progress, still in its early phase, with a completion date set by Beijing for the \\nmid-21st Century. Cross-border infrastructure projects are some of the most difficult to \\nimplement as they require complex and often protracted negotiations over proposed routes, \\ndevelopment rights, financing and investment returns. After all, it took the UN Economic and \\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) almost 15 years between the \\nlaunching of its Asian Land Transportation Infrastructure Program in 1992 and the signing of \\nintergovernmental agreements on the Asian Highway Network (2003) and Trans-Asian \\nRailway Network (2006). In contrast, it took China less than five years to launch and operate a \\nmultilateral financial institution (AIIB), and to create global momentum around Eurasian \\ninfrastructure building. No head of State or government across the large geographic area \\nincluded in BRI has not heard about the Chinese initiative, included BRI in their diplomatic \\nagendas for dialogues with Chinese counterparts, paid careful attention Beijing\\u2019s promises of \\ncapital and of a new type of \\u201cmutually beneficial cooperation,\\u201d and started to think about how \\ntheir country could benefit from it, one way or another. What country, other than China, shows \\nas much consistency and apparent dedication in its political, diplomatic and financial \\ncommitment to such a complex, diverse, unstable, and conflicted region, one that has been \\nstruggling for years to achieve economic development?  \\n\\nYes, difficulties have emerged. Pakistan and Nepal, for example, have recently announced that \\nthey are reconsidering some BRI projects, because of unacceptable financing conditions in the \\n\\n10 \\u201cInternational Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace,\\u201d Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cyberspace \\nAdministration of China, March 02, 2017, accessed at http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-\\n03/02/content_28410278.htm \\n11 \\u201cList of Deliverables of Belt and Road Forum,\\u201d Xinhua, May 15, 2017, accessed at \\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/15/c_136286376.htm  \\n12 Wu Gang, \\u201cSOEs Lead Infrastructure Push in 1,700 \\u2018Belt and Road\\u2019 Projects,\\u201d Caixin, May 9, 2017, accessed \\nat https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-05-10/101088332.html \\n\\n21Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nfirst instance and irregularities in the bidding process in the second.13 BRI will probably \\nencounter more setbacks in the future, including local resistance to Beijing\\u2019s financial \\nconditions, an influx of Chinese manpower, or potentially harmful environmental impacts.

These characteristics are just a reflection of a system that \\nworks differently than ours.

After all, BRI\\u2019s success is not going to be \\ncounted in miles of railways laid on the ground, nor in pounds of steel exported to emerging \\nmarkets, but in increased Chinese influence and possible domination over a key region of the \\nworld.

HILLMAN:  Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. \\nIn keeping with the panel's theme, I will focus on the Belt and Road's economic \\n\\ndimensions.  Very briefly, I'd like to just touch on four areas: first, key trends in Belt and Road \\nprojects; second, China's tools for advancing the Belt and Road; third, the Belt and Road's \\neconomic and political impacts; and also implications for the United States. \\n\\nAs has been mentioned, I think the Belt and Road is probably the best known but \\nleast understood foreign policy effort underway today.  And for all the attention it receives, \\nthere's little reliable information about how it's unfolding in aggregate. \\n\\nA major challenge is that the BRI label evades classification, both geographically, \\ntemporally, functionally, and I think by design, the BRI is really a vision and in some cases a \\nloose brand more than it is a masterplan with strict criteria for inclusion. \\n\\nInfrastructure is not the only component of the Belt and Road, but it is a major \\ncomponent, and I think it's important in that it provides a window into the Belt and Road's \\ndrivers and broader implications.  And for the past three years, CSIS has been tracking \\ninfrastructure projects across the Eurasian supercontinent. \\n\\nWe have a database of about 2,200 projects--transportation projects--that include \\nnot only Chinese-funded projects but what others are doing in the region, and as that database \\ngrows, several trends are emerging.  I'll just note one of them that has I think both economic and \\npolitical implications. \\n\\nSo one major question about the Belt and Road is its openness, you know the \\ndegree to which others can participate and benefit from it.  And our data to date suggests that \\nChinese projects are less open to local and international participation. \\n\\nOut of all the contractors participating in Chinese-funded projects within our \\ndatabase, about 89 percent are Chinese companies, about seven percent are local companies, \\nmeaning that they're headquartered in the same country where the project is taking place, and \\nabout three percent are foreign companies so non-Chinese companies from a country other than \\nthe one in which the project was taking place. \\n\\nThe mix of contractors for projects funded by the World Bank and Asian \\nDevelopment Bank is much more evenly distributed, and I think this finding, while not shocking \\nto those of us who follow this, it does remind us that despite official rhetoric about the Belt and \\nRoad being open and global, it is, I think, first and foremost, a Chinese-centric effort.   \\n\\nThese trends could change over time, as has been mentioned.  This is a very long-\\nterm initiative, and it's also possible that Western firms are more competitive in other areas such \\nas providing consulting and legal services. \\n\\nAnd I think over the longer term even China stands to benefit from greater \\ntransparency and openness.  Right now, there is I think genuine interest among U.S. and other \\nWestern firms in participating in Belt and Road related projects, but unless more opportunities \\nare made for them to do so, I think that interest will wane and suspicion will rise. \\n\\nChina uses several tools to boost its exports, many of them now falling under the \\nBelt and Road banner: national champions; credit; infrastructure; and trade agreements.  I think \\n\\n2323\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nwe could spend an entire hearing discussing any one of those but what's I think equally important \\nis how China is bringing those tools together. \\n\\nIts approach is what I think is both centralized but flexible.  It's centralized in that \\nwhen a recipient country receives an offer from China, it often interacts with all the key actors \\nwho present a more unified front, and this is in contrast to the traditional Western approach, \\nwhich involves dealing separately with a wider range of less coordinated actors. \\n\\nChina is also flexible because it's willing to work with any government.  It's \\nwilling to build to budget and with less stringent requirements for meeting safeguards, and it's \\nwilling to accept often a broader range of payment terms. \\n\\nI think this approach magnifies the short-term incentives for starting projects, but \\nI think it also masks some long-term risks. \\n\\nThe BRI's political and economic impacts I think could be even, even \\ncontradictory over the longer term.  Right now I think we see evidence of the Belt and Road's \\npolitical success, but over the long term that political impact will depend on implementation of \\nthese projects. \\n\\nSo politically--I think this will be covered later today--China is already becoming \\ncloser with traditional partners like Pakistan.  It's making deeper ties and inroads with countries \\nfurther west such as those in Eastern and Central Europe.  Several countries have announced \\ntheir intentions to link their own development strategies with the Belt and Road.  \\n\\nBut economically and politically, the Belt and Road also faces some near-term \\nconstraints and longer-term challenges.  When smaller economies do business with China, I \\nthink we need to remember that they're not directly aligning themselves.  They're often trying to \\nbalance.  And so, you know, you see a competition that is emerging not only between--it's not \\njust China, but there are other regional actors who are quite involved--Japan, India, Russia, \\nothers, South Korea. \\n\\nNot all of the Belt and Road's political impacts have been positive to date.  I think \\nthere is an emerging gap between expectations among countries who have joined the Initiative \\nand the benefits that they've received for doing so. \\n\\nAnd over time, I think that support for the Belt and Road could change depending \\non how it's implemented.  It could decline and even turn against China.  We need to remember \\nthat large infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time, on budget and with their promised \\nbenefits, even in the best business environments, and so when projects disappoint for any reason, \\nwhich they I think will inevitably do so over the coming years, China stands to suffer some \\nreputational damage.  And it's possible that what looks like boldness today could look like hubris \\nin two decades. \\n\\nThe United States has a range of economic interests at stake, and I'm hoping we \\ncan maybe discuss a bit of that today.  I think there's the obvious commercial interest.  There's \\nalso a longer-term broader economic interest in the stability of major systems--trade, finance, \\nand so on. \\n\\nAnd I think that a Belt and Road that succeeds on China's terms would revise \\nthose systems to reflect Chinese interests.  A Belt and Road that fails would also have \\nconsequences for the U.S. that would not be positive.  I think, you know, a Belt and Road that \\nfails spectacularly could harm regional growth, and that would have implications for us as well. \\n\\nSo I will leave it there, and I look forward to unpacking some more of that further.  \\nThank you. \\n\\n2424\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF JONATHAN HILLMAN \\nFELLOW AND DIRECTOR, RECONNECTING ASIA PROJECT, CENTER FOR \\n\\nSTRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES \\n\\n2525\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n1 \\n\\n Statement Before the \\nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\\n\\n\\u201cChina\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative: Five Years Later\\u201d \\n\\nA Testimony by: \\n\\nJonathan Hillman \\n\\nFellow, Simon Chair in Political Economy, and Director, Reconnecting \\n\\nAsia Project  \\n\\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\n419 Dirksen Senate Office Building \\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n2 \\n\\nIntroduction \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to testify on China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its \\n\\nimplications for U.S. interests. The Commission asked me to focus on the BRI\\u2019s economic \\n\\ndimensions. I will address four key questions in this regard: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 What are the key trends in BRI projects to date, and to what extent do BRI projects\\n\\nfollow market rules and international standards?\\n\\n\\uf0b7 What tools has Beijing used to boost Chinese exports under the BRI?\\n\\n\\uf0b7 How has the BRI affected China\\u2019s trade and investment patterns, its diplomatic reach,\\n\\nand its soft power?\\n\\n\\uf0b7 What are the economic implications of the BRI for the United States?\\n\\nAfter addressing these questions, I will conclude with brief recommendations for Congressional \\n\\naction.  \\n\\nHot Spots and Blind Spots: Key Trends in BRI Projects \\n\\nThe BRI is the most ambitious geoeconomic vision in recent history. Spanning some 70 \\n\\ncountries, it can claim to cover more than two-thirds of the world\\u2019s population. It could include \\n\\nChinese investments approaching $4 trillion.1 It intends to strengthen hard infrastructure with \\n\\nnew roads and railways, soft infrastructure with trade and transportation agreements, and even \\n\\ncultural ties with university scholarships and other people-to-people exchanges. In all these \\n\\nways, when much of the West is looking inward, China is connecting with the world. \\n\\nThe BRI is also the best-known, least-understood foreign policy effort underway. Beyond \\n\\ninvestments in actual projects, China spends significant resources organizing BRI events, \\n\\npromoting BRI stories, and conducting other outreach. Recognition within and outside China has \\n\\nbeen growing. Chinese state media claim that global awareness of the BRI has tripled between \\n\\n2014 and 2017, increasing from 6 percent to 18 percent in a survey of 22 countries.2 Nearly 30 \\n\\nworld leaders and representatives from 110 countries and international organizations attended the \\n\\nBRI Forum in May 2017. The event, hosted by President Xi Jinping, received significant global \\n\\ncoverage. Attention and awareness continues to climb, especially in the West. In recent weeks, \\n\\nthe Financial Times,3 the New York Times,4 and other international outlets have all included \\n\\nreporting on BRI-related projects.    \\n\\n1 \\u201cOur bulldozers, our rules,\\u201d The Economist, July 2, 2016. https://www.economist.com/news/china/21701505-\\n\\nchinas-foreign-policy-could-reshape-good-part-world-economy-our-bulldozers-our-rules.

A major challenge is that the BRI label evades classification. There is no \\n\\nagreed-upon definition for what qualifies as a BRI project.5 There are roughly 70 countries \\n\\nparticipating in the BRI, according to Chinese state media. Yet there are Chinese-funded projects \\n\\nin non-participant countries that share many of the same characteristics. The BRI was officially \\n\\nlaunched in November 2013, but projects started years earlier are often counted. The BRI banner \\n\\nhangs over a wide and ever-expanding list of activities. There are BRI fashion shows, concerts, \\n\\nand art exhibits. By design, the BRI is more a loose brand than a program with strict criteria.   \\n\\nInfrastructure is a major component of the BRI and provides a window into its drivers and \\n\\nbroader implications. For three years, the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic \\n\\nand International Studies (CSIS) has been tracking infrastructure projects across the Eurasian \\n\\nsupercontinent. Our website, ReconnectingAsia.CSIS.org, has an interactive map, an open-\\n\\nsource database of over 2,200 transportation projects, and expert analysis. To date, this database \\n\\nhas focused on transportation projects: road, railroads, seaports, and dry ports. It will expand in \\n\\nthe future to include power plants, pipelines, telecommunications, and other connectivity \\n\\ninfrastructure. China is not the only focal point of this database, which covers all funders, but it \\n\\nis the most active. \\n\\nAs this database grows, several trends are emerging. First, China is often the biggest spender, but \\n\\nit is not the only consequential actor. Across the Eurasian supercontinent, three zones of \\n\\ncompetition are emerging. In Southeast Asia, Japan is outspending China in several countries. In \\n\\nCentral Asia, the Asian Development Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDB) \\n\\nhave significant activities underway. In Eastern and Central Europe, European funders remain \\n\\ndominant in many countries. To be sure, this is not a zero-sum contest, and there are numerous \\n\\nprojects with both Chinese and MDB funding. These areas will be important to watch as China \\n\\ncontinues to compete with, and adapt to, other visions for connectivity. \\n\\nSecond, Chinese projects are less open to local and international participation. Out of all \\n\\ncontractors participating in Chinese-funded projects within the Reconnecting Asia database, 89 \\n\\npercent are Chinese companies, 7.6 percent are local companies (companies headquartered in the \\n\\nsame country where the project was taking place), and 3.4 percent are foreign companies (non-\\n\\nChinese companies from a country other than the one where the project was taking place). In \\n\\ncomparison, out of the contractors participating in projects funded by the multilateral \\n\\ndevelopment banks, 29 percent are Chinese, 40.8 percent are local, and 30.2 percent are foreign.  \\n\\nThese findings illuminate some difficult practical and political realities. Practically speaking, it \\n\\nshould not come as a surprise that Chinese companies are winning more contracts for Chinese-\\n\\nfunded projects. Despite official rhetoric about the BRI being open and global, it is a China-\\n\\ncentric effort. Chinese companies are also extremely competitive in the transportation sector. It is \\n\\npossible that Western firms are more competitive in providing related services around these \\n\\nprojects, such as consulting and legal services, but further research is needed. China\\u2019s advantage \\n\\nalso stems from some of the tools it uses, which are explained further in the next section.  \\n\\n5 Rather than adopt a superficial definition, I use the phrase \\u201cBRI-related project\\u201d broadly to describe infrastructure \\n\\nprojects with Chinese funding.  \\n\\n28Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n4 \\n\\nThird, Chinese projects are less transparent at earlier stages of the project lifecycle. The \\n\\nReconnecting Asia Project recently ran an experiment that scored the project pages in our \\n\\ndatabase for completeness. Projects with more data fields completed received more points. \\n\\nScoring was adjusted based on the project status. A project that is just under negotiation, for \\n\\nexample, would not be expected to have as much information as a completed project. We found \\n\\nno meaningful difference in the amount of information available for Chinese-funded projects \\n\\nversus projects supported by various multilateral development banks. They all scored in the low \\n\\nto mid 80\\u2019s out of 100, roughly B\\u2019s and B-minuses.  \\n\\nBut transparency is tricky. How do you evaluate projects that you cannot find? To get closer to \\n\\nanswering that question, we examined the status levels for projects in our database. We have six \\n\\nstatus levels \\u2013 beginning with \\u201cannounced\\u201d and ending with \\u201ccompleted\\u201d or \\u201ccancelled\\u201d \\u2013 and \\n\\nthere are some projects for which the status is unknown. What jumped out in this comparison \\n\\nbetween MDB projects and projects from the China Development Bank is the difference in early \\n\\nstage projects. About 7 percent of our MDB projects are marked as announced, which is the \\n\\nearliest stage in our database. To date, the database does not have any China Development Bank \\n\\n(CDB) projects in the earliest stage (\\u201cannounced\\u201d), and it has a higher percentage of CDB \\n\\nprojects that are completed. \\n\\nThese trends could change over time. Indeed, it is in everyone\\u2019s long-term interest that projects \\n\\nare open and transparent. Greater openness and transparency benefits recipient countries by \\n\\nensuring the companies participating are the best for the job. If there is little or no information \\n\\navailable publicly about early stage projects, it is impossible to have an open and fair \\n\\ncompetition. Even China stands to benefit over the longer term. Right now, U.S. and other \\n\\nWestern firms are genuinely interested in participating in BRI-related projects. But unless there \\n\\nare more opportunities to participate, that interest will wane and suspicion will rise. More \\n\\ncountries will start to ask why they joined the BRI, and those that have not joined will not.  \\n\\nThe Visible Hand: China\\u2019s Tools \\n\\nChina uses several tools to boost its exports, many of them now falling under the BRI banner: \\n\\nnational champions, credit, infrastructure, and trade agreements. Chinese state-owned enterprises \\n\\n(SOEs) often benefit from tremendous scale and subsidies. They have dramatically moved up the \\n\\nglobal rankings in recent years. In 2000, Fortune\\u2019s Global 500 list of the world\\u2019s largest \\n\\ncompanies by revenue included 10 Chinese firms, of which 9 were state-owned. 6 In 2017, the \\n\\nlist included 107 Chinese firms, of which 75 were state-owned. This trend is especially stark in \\n\\nthe construction industry. In 2017, seven of the ten largest construction companies in the world, \\n\\nby revenue, were Chinese.7 When Chinese SOEs compete for foreign contracts, they bring these \\n\\nadvantages to the table. \\n\\n6 \\u201cThe changing headquarters landscape for Fortune Global 500 companies,\\u201d Ernst & Young LLP, October 31, \\n\\n2017. https://taxnews.ey.com/news/2017-1810-the-changing-headquarters-landscape-for-fortune-global-500-\\n\\ncompanies  \\n7 \\u201cTop 250 Global Contractors,\\u201d Engineering News-Record, August 2017. https://www.enr.com/toplists/2017-Top-\\n\\n250-Global-Contractors-1\\n\\n29Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n5 \\n\\nCredit is a powerful incentive. According to researchers at William and Mary, Chinese lending \\n\\nduring 2000-2014 totaled $354.4 billion, with lending highest in the transport and power \\n\\nsectors.8 Of these loans, about three quarters had commercial terms. China is successful at \\n\\nlocking in higher rates because it agrees to assume risks that other lenders will not. In Sri Lanka, \\n\\nwhich I visited earlier this month, China was willing to provide a $1.3 billion loan for a new port \\n\\nafter MDBs declined. After Sri Lanka could not repay the interest on its debt, China agreed to \\n\\ntake equity in the port. China is also proactive, offering to pursue projects without solicitation. Its \\n\\nloans to Sri Lanka now exceed $8 billion, a sum that grew as leaders found each project too \\n\\ntempting to turn down.9  \\n\\nInfrastructure projects have short and long-term implications for Chinese exports. In the short \\n\\nterm, these projects are aiding Chinese exports of construction-related goods. Chinese exports to \\n\\nPakistan, for example, increased 77 percent between 2012 and 2015.10 Chinese producers of \\n\\nsteel, concrete, and other construction materials stand to benefit from projects that use them, as \\n\\ndo Chinese engineering and construction firms. These activities provide important but modest \\n\\nrelief for Chinese overcapacity, a problem that will still need to be addressed even if the BRI\\u2019s \\n\\nambitious spending targets are reached. Despite the BRI\\u2019s scale, it is too small to solve China\\u2019s \\n\\novercapacity challenges.11    \\n\\nOver the longer term, new infrastructure could facilitate trade by improving connectivity \\n\\nbetween China and its trading partners. The actual impacts will depend on both macro and micro \\n\\nfactors, such as the trajectories of the recipient economies and whether the right projects were \\n\\nselected. There is no question the region needs infrastructure investment. Developing Asia alone \\n\\nrequires $26 trillion in infrastructure investment between 2017 and 2030 to maintain current \\n\\ngrowth rates and adapt to climate change, according to ADB estimates.12 If all that infrastructure \\n\\nappeared tomorrow, flawlessly built where markets required it, there would be large trade gains. \\n\\nBut many barriers to trade would still remain, from onerous customs paperwork to divergent \\n\\nstandards. Upgrading Asia\\u2019s \\u201csoft\\u201d infrastructure will be important as well.  \\n\\nTrade agreements could provide that upgrade, and they have been placed under the BRI banner \\n\\nas well. Chinese officials have described a network of free trade agreements that would support \\n\\nthe BRI, but to date, China appears primarily focused on bilateral trade deals.13 Given the diverse \\n\\nlist of countries participating in the BRI, a BRI-wide trade agreement is highly unlikely. While \\n\\nlowering barriers between China and individual markets, additional bilateral deals could further \\n\\n8 AidData. 2017.

China\\u2019s approach is centralized yet \\n\\nflexible. It is centralized in bringing together many of the above elements in a single deal. When \\n\\na recipient country considers an offer from China, it often interacts with all the key actors, who \\n\\noften present a unified front. This differs from the \\u201cWestern approach,\\u201d which involves dealing \\n\\nseparately with a wider range of actors, including some who coordinate loosely, others that \\n\\noperate independently, and others that actively compete with each other.15   \\n\\nChina\\u2019s approach is flexible in at least three respects. First, China is willing to work with any \\n\\ngovernment. While this approach predates the BRI, it can be seen in the list of BRI participants, \\n\\nwhich even includes participants with active conflicts, such as Syria and Yemen.16 Second, \\n\\nChina is often willing to build to budget and with less stringent requirements for meeting social \\n\\nand environmental safeguards. Third, China is flexible in negotiating payment terms. It is willing \\n\\nto accept natural resources, for example, and when loans cannot be repaid it is sometimes willing \\n\\nto take equity. Centralization and flexibility provide more ways to get to \\u201cyes,\\u201d and they help get \\n\\nthere faster.   \\n\\nAll these tools magnify short-term incentives for starting projects, but they can also mask long-\\n\\nterm risks. \\n\\nAccess and Influence: Economic and Political Impacts \\n\\nThe economic and political impacts of the BRI are difficult to isolate and could even have \\n\\nopposing short and long-term implications. As noted earlier, the BRI is more a brand than a \\n\\nmaster plan with specific criteria for project inclusion. Temporally, functionally, and \\n\\ngeographically, what counts as a BRI project is open to interpretation. Even obvious cases can \\n\\nhave complicating factors. For example, there is a lag between the announcement of \\n\\ninfrastructure projects, construction, completion, and usage. The economic impact of a recently-\\n\\ncompleted railway project, for example, will not become clear for several years. This is a \\n\\nfrustrating answer, particularly for a hearing with a title that reminds us that the BRI\\u2019s fifth \\n\\nanniversary is later this year. Consistent, long-term monitoring of BRI-related activities will be \\n\\nimportant for finding more exact answers.   \\n\\nChinese government statements about the BRI\\u2019s economic impacts help illustrate these \\n\\nchallenges. Chinese officials and state media often frame the BRI\\u2019s impacts in broad terms. It is \\n\\ncommon to hear about trade, investment, tourism, and other flows between China and \\u201cBRI \\n\\n14 \\u201cChina signs over 130 transport pacts with Belt and Road countries,\\u201d CGTN, April 21, 2017. \\nhttp://www.scio.gov.cn/31773/35507/35520/Document/1549108/1549108.htm  \\n\\n15 For more research on differences between Western and Chinese approaches to infrastructure, see: CSIS and \\nStanford Global Projects Center, \\u201cConstructing a New Global Order,\\u201d December 18, 2017.  \\n\\nhttps://www.csis.org/events/western-and-chinese-infrastructure-development-abroad  \\n\\n16 Jonathan Hillman, \\u201cWill China\\u2019s Belt and Road stretch further?\\u201d Nikkei Asian Review, December 26, 2017. \\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Viewpoints/Jonathan-Hillman/Will-China-s-Belt-and-Road-stretch-further    \\n\\n31Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n7 \\n\\npartners\\u201d or \\u201cBRI countries.\\u201d17 Some studies have claimed the BRI is greatly enhancing these \\n\\nconnections. But they use questionable timelines, often relying on data that predates the BRI, and \\n\\ndo not separate recent developments from economic trends that were underway before the BRI. \\n\\nOther popular metrics are often incomplete. For example, Chinese state media trumpet the \\n\\nincrease in freight train services between China and Europe. But they do not state the value of \\n\\ncargo carried, and they rarely refer to trains traveling in the opposite direction, which occur less \\n\\nfrequently and carry more empty containers.  \\n\\nWith these challenges in mind, there are some nascent trends that merit further observation. First, \\n\\nChinese outbound capital restrictions appear to be more relaxed for BRI-related transactions. \\n\\nDeals that might be classified as advancing the BRI are more likely to be approved, and to be \\n\\napproved faster.18 In contrast, China has been reining in outbound deals for foreign real estate, \\n\\nentertainment, and sports teams.19 Third, the BRI\\u2019s emphasis on infrastructure has helped boost \\n\\nChinese exports of construction-related goods and services. The longer-term trajectories of these \\n\\ntrends, whether outbound capital is invested effectively and transportation corridors mature into \\n\\neconomic corridors, hinge on implementation.  \\n\\nPolitically, China is already benefitting from the BRI with individual countries and globally. \\n\\nTraditional partners like Pakistan, where BRI-related investments total roughly $62 billion, have \\n\\nbecome even closer. Chinese infrastructure loans have helped persuade some countries, \\n\\nincluding the Philippines and Cambodia, to reevaluate military or diplomatic ties with the United \\n\\nStates. China is also forging ties with countries further west, particularly those in Central and \\n\\nEastern Europe. China\\u2019s \\u201c16+1\\u201d framework brings together a diverse set of countries in the \\n\\nregion, many of whom have little in common other than their interest in doing business with \\n\\nChina. These and other developments suggest the BRI is producing political dividends. \\n\\nGlobally, the BRI positions China as the leader of a new form of globalization. Much of this \\n\\nrhetoric sounds familiar, but carries a different meaning. For example, in his opening remarks at \\n\\nthe BRI Forum in May 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke about upholding the \\n\\nmultilateral trading system, liberalizing investment, and promoting transparent rules. \\u201cWe should \\n\\nbuild an open platform of cooperation,\\u201d he urged, \\u201cand uphold and grow an open world \\n\\neconomy.\\u201d But the BRI\\u2019s openness is questionable, as evident in the contractor trends noted \\n\\nearlier. Yet other countries are beginning to echo this rhetoric. Several have announced their \\n\\nintentions to \\u201clink\\u201d their national development plans and broader economic initiatives with the \\n\\nBRI.  \\n\\nEconomically and politically, the BRI also faces near-term constraints and longer-term \\n\\nchallenges. When smaller economies do business with China, they are often balancing rather \\n\\n17 In addition to their analytical shortcomings, these framings should also be avoided because they carry negative \\npolitical connotations.

Dependencies can develop over time, of course, as Sri Lanka\\u2019s \\n\\nexperience illustrates. But smaller countries also seek to diversify their economic relationships. \\n\\nIn 2016, for example, every leader that took office in Southeast Asia discussed infrastructure \\n\\nprojects with both China and Japan. \\u201cThis is a good competition,\\u201d Indonesia\\u2019s Finance Minister \\n\\nSri Mulyani Indrawati said last year.20 A key question for the longer term is whether this \\n\\ncompetition fosters a race to the top in standards and quality, or a race to the bottom.  \\n\\nNot all the BRI\\u2019s political impacts have been positive. For some countries that have signed on, \\n\\nthere is a gap emerging between expectations and actual benefits. South Korea has embraced the \\n\\ninitiative, for example, but it has yet to cooperate with China on concrete projects. Economic \\n\\ncooperation has been held up by differences over North Korea, highlighting how the BRI can \\n\\nquickly take a backseat to other interests.21 The BRI has been met with various degrees of \\n\\nskepticism and concern elsewhere, such as Western Europe, Japan, and India. The BRI\\u2019s roster \\n\\nmay seem long at roughly 70 participants, but that still leaves about 125 countries that have not \\n\\njoined. Ultimately, the BRI\\u2019s longer-term political impacts hinge on its execution and its \\n\\neconomic performance.  \\n\\nOver time, support for the BRI could decline and even turn against China. Large infrastructure \\n\\nprojects are rarely delivered on time, on budget, with their promised benefits\\u2014even in the best \\n\\nbusinesses environments.22 Most BRI-related projects will encounter difficulties in the coming \\n\\nyears. Projects that rely too heavily on Chinese labor, rather than local labor, can stoke \\n\\nresentment. Some projects will fail outright. Others will creep along and succeed only partially \\u2013 \\n\\ndelivering some commercial benefits, for example, while also introducing environmental costs. \\n\\nWhen projects disappoint for any reason, China stands to suffer reputational damage. What looks \\n\\nlike boldness today might look like hubris in two decades.   \\n\\nThe BRI is also constrained by China\\u2019s domestic political imperatives. The BRI aims to increase \\n\\nthe flow of goods and people, but China\\u2019s overbearing security presence near border areas is \\n\\nsuffocating commercial activity. Chinese capital controls, while favoring outbound investment \\n\\nfor BRI-related projects, are still inefficient and overly restrictive for inbound investments. The \\n\\nBRI aspires to promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge, but Chinese censorship is \\n\\nincreasing. These trends all contradict the BRI\\u2019s expressed goal of improving global \\n\\nconnectivity. Beijing\\u2019s dilemma is that greater connectivity requires giving up some control.  \\n\\nWinning Business and Shaping Systems: U.S. Economic Interests \\n\\nWhether the BRI succeeds or fails, its vast scale and scope guarantees consequences for U.S. \\n\\ninterests.

Commercial opportunities should exist for U.S. suppliers, service providers, and \\n\\ninvestors to participate in BRI-related projects. To date, U.S. suppliers that have participated \\n\\nhave often done so through joint-ventures with Chinese firms. There are also opportunities for \\n\\nU.S. logistics firms and other potential users of completed projects. Hewlett-Packard, for \\n\\nexample, was an early pioneer of the direct China-Europe freight trains that are now expanding. \\n\\nTo date, however, U.S. and Western firm participation in BRI-related projects has been relatively \\n\\nmodest.  \\n\\nAt least three barriers stand between U.S. companies and BRI-related projects. First, companies \\n\\nneed access to timely and accurate information about BRI-related opportunities. Many U.S. \\n\\ncompanies are now aware of the BRI\\u2019s potential scale and wide range of activities, but they are \\n\\nstruggling to identify concrete business opportunities. As noted earlier, one of the nascent trends \\n\\nin the CSIS Reconnecting Asia database is that public information about some Chinese-funded \\n\\nprojects is more difficult to obtain in the project\\u2019s earliest stages, which is typically when bids \\n\\nare solicited. Greater transparency would help. \\n\\nSecond, after learning about specific opportunities, U.S. companies sometimes confront an \\n\\nuneven playing field. Many of the tools for advancing the BRI noted earlier give Chinese firms \\n\\nan edge in winning contracts. National champions benefit from state subsidies. Financing can be \\n\\ntied to picking Chinese firms. As noted earlier, the low participation of U.S. contractors in \\n\\nChinese-funded transportation projects is not a challenge unique to U.S. firms but affects non-\\n\\nChinese firms more generally. Different methods for estimating project costs and revenues can \\n\\nalso favor Chinese firms. These considerations extend beyond U.S. competitiveness and also \\n\\nimpact recipient countries, which risk entering commitments without fully accounting for \\n\\noperations, maintenance, and other lifecycle costs.  \\n\\nThird, even if competition is open and fair, a host of risks can outweigh the potential rewards for \\n\\nU.S. firms. Partnering with foreign firms can present IP-theft risks. Elections, corruption, \\n\\ncomplicated land rights, and other political and legal risks can threaten a project\\u2019s viability. \\n\\nFunding risks arise from the capital-intensive nature of infrastructure projects, long repayment \\n\\nschedules, and the challenges that developing economies might encounter along the way.23 When \\n\\nprojects are completed, weak demand and other operational challenges remain. These risks are a \\n\\nprimary reason why U.S. institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, \\n\\nrarely venture into emerging market infrastructure.    \\n\\nEven more important to U.S. economic interests is the BRI\\u2019s longer-term impact on major global \\n\\nsystems. Since World War II, the United States has played a leading role in creating, expanding, \\n\\nand defending open trade and financial systems. The United States has done this not merely out \\n\\nof goodwill, but also out of self-interest. U.S. economic strength flows from the dynamism of its \\n\\nprivate sector and the U.S. economy\\u2019s central position within these systems. Of course, \\n\\nglobalization has also produced costs at home, a critical challenge that must be addressed but is \\n\\noutside the scope of this hearing. But as foreign markets have grown over the past seven-plus \\n\\ndecades, so has the United States.   \\n\\n23 David Wijeratne, et al. \\u201cRepaving the ancient Silk Roads,\\u201d PricewaterhouseCoopers, May 2017. \\n\\nhttps://www.pwc.com/gx/en/growth-markets-centre/assets/pdf/pwc-gmc-repaving-the-ancient-silk-routes-web.pdf \\n\\n34Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n10 \\n\\nA BRI that succeeds on China\\u2019s terms could revise these systems to reflect Chinese interests. \\n\\nChanges would be seen in supply chains for goods, from manufactured products to energy and \\n\\nother resources. China\\u2019s currency would become more widely used. Chinese technical standards, \\n\\nfor everything from high-speed railway systems to wireless networks, would become more \\n\\nwidely adopted, as would Chinese preferences for environmental and social safeguards. \\n\\nCollectively, these changes would push the United States away from its current position in the \\n\\nglobal economy and move China toward the center.   \\n\\nA BRI that fails also has implications for U.S. economic interests. The financial burden that \\n\\ndeveloping economies are assuming through Chinese loans is considerable. Many recipients are \\n\\ncounting on sustaining high GDP growth to pay back their loans, setting ambitious targets that \\n\\nleave little room for error or unexpected events. Many of today\\u2019s assumptions about China are \\n\\nalso based on its spectacular rates of growth over recent decades. Events within or outside China \\n\\ncould lead to enough of these loans failing as to impact the broader global economy. Rather than \\n\\nhelping write the next chapter in regional integration, a failing BRI could set the region back, \\n\\nharming global growth. \\n\\nThese economic developments carry strategic implications as well. A separate panel will address \\n\\nstrategic concerns in greater detail, but two areas are intimately tied with the BRI\\u2019s infrastructure \\n\\nfocus and should be briefly noted. First, transportation infrastructure is dual-use, meaning that it \\n\\ncan be used to move goods to market as well as militaries to battle. Second and more broadly, the \\n\\nUnited States has the same fundamental interest it has had since World War II in ensuring that no \\n\\nsingle power dominates the Eurasian supercontinent. If a hegemon does emerge, history suggests \\n\\nthat new infrastructure will be an important indicator and vehicle for influence. \\n\\nRecommendations \\n\\nThe United States must not only be vigilant, it must advance a vision of its own for the region. It \\n\\nis sobering to recall the U.S. position in Asia at the beginning of this century. In 2000, a \\n\\nbipartisan commission at the Harvard Kennedy School examined U.S. national interests and \\n\\nnoted, \\u201cNo country in East Asia, including China, appears capable of seriously challenging US \\n\\nleadership any time soon unless America, through neglect or indifference, were to create a \\n\\nvacuum.\\u201d24 Today, the U.S. position in Asia is considerably weaker. Neglect can be seen in the \\n\\nU.S. decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Indifference can be seen in the \\n\\nabsence of a positive U.S. economic vision for the region. \\n\\nThe Administration\\u2019s support for a \\u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific\\u201d is a welcome development. \\n\\nFeatured prominently in both the U.S. National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, \\n\\nthis framing has several strengths. It focuses on what is likely to be the main arena for great \\n\\npower competition, economically and strategically, in the twenty-first century. It emphasizes the \\n\\nmaritime domain, which despite the BRI\\u2019s ambitions to create new economic corridors across the \\n\\n24 Graham Allison, et al. \\u201cAmerica\\u2019s National Interests: A Report from The Commission on America's National \\nInterests,\\u201d Harvard Kennedy School, July 2000. https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/americas-national-\\n\\ninterests-report-commission-americas-national-interests-2000  \\n\\n35Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n11 \\n\\nEurasian landmass, will remain the primary conduit for global trade. It positions the U.S. to work \\n\\nclosely with allies and partners in the region, many of whom have expressed similar aspirations.  \\n\\nBut more must be done to operationalize these ideas. Resources matter more than rhetoric. For \\n\\nexample, it is necessary but not sufficient to warn recipient countries against risky lending and \\n\\nquestionable projects. Put yourself in the shoes of a foreign leader seeking international support \\n\\nfor infrastructure projects. On the one hand, you have offers for specific projects that could start \\n\\nimmediately. On the other hand, you have warnings about medium and long-term risks. \\n\\nPolitically and psychologically, the scales are tilted toward taking the risky offer today. Even the \\n\\nstrongest language is not likely to persuade recipient countries to turn down risky infrastructure \\n\\noffers, particularly those with acute development needs. What\\u2019s needed are better alternatives.  \\n\\nWorking with the Administration, Congress has an important role to play in operationalizing the \\n\\n\\u201cIndo-Pacific\\u201d concept and expanding the availability of better financing alternatives. First, \\n\\nCongress should direct the Administration to establish standards and principles for infrastructure \\n\\ninvestment in the region. There is growing recognition about the importance of \\u201cquality \\n\\ninfrastructure,\\u201d but there are competing definitions for what quality means. The challenge is not \\n\\nonly building consensus about preferred outcomes, but also the processes that lead to better \\n\\noutcomes. These standards would cover procurement, environmental and social safeguards, and \\n\\ndebt sustainability, among other issues. \\n\\nSecond, to build international support for these principles, Congress should preserve U.S. \\n\\ninfluence in the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral development \\n\\nbanks. China alone cannot meet Asia\\u2019s infrastructure needs, and these institutions will remain \\n\\ncentral in setting standards and providing alternatives. The Administration can also build support \\n\\nby working with partners and allies and through the G-20 and other multilateral bodies. Done \\n\\ncorrectly, these principles will take hold not only in Asia, but in other regions where competing \\n\\napproaches exist, such as Eastern and Central Europe.  \\n\\nThird, to help U.S. companies compete overseas, Congress should strengthen the U.S. foreign \\n\\neconomic policy toolkit. Concerns about the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private \\n\\nInvestment Corporation crowding out private sector investment, while grounded in economic \\n\\ntheory, are at odds with economic reality. Foreign governments have already tilted the playing \\n\\nfield. There is merit in considering whether some U.S. commercial agencies could be \\n\\nconsolidated and streamlined for greater efficiency and unity of action, but the bottom line is that \\n\\ntheir activities should be fully resourced, as should the U.S. Department of State. \\n\\nTo be sure, the United States should not aspire to replicate the BRI\\u2019s scale with federal spending. \\n\\nBut through resourcing the efforts mentioned above, the U.S. and its partners and allies can \\n\\nexpand private sector investment. Globally, institutional investors\\u2014such as pension funds, \\n\\nmutual funds, insurance companies, and others such as sovereign wealth funds\\u2014manage more \\n\\nthan $100 trillion.25 Only a small fraction of that largess is invested in infrastructure. The actions \\n\\n25 Rabah Arezki, et al. \\u201cFrom Global Savings Glut to Financing Infrastructure: The Advent of Investment \\nPlatforms,\\u201d International Monetary Fund, February 2016. \\n\\nhttps://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp1618.pdf  \\n\\n36Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nHillman: Written Testimony, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  1/25/2018\\n\\n12 \\n\\nrecommended above would help manage risks, expand the pool of bankable projects, and \\n\\nmobilize more private capital. \\n\\nThe BRI has all the marks of a difficult foreign policy challenge.

PHILLIPS:  Thank you very much and thank you to the Commission for this \\n\\nopportunity to address this issue. \\nSimilar to my fellow panelists on this, this issue is something that needs to be \\n\\ntaken very seriously.  As was mentioned, when this came out in November of 2013, it caught \\nmany people by surprise, mostly the Chinese bureaucracy and the SOE realm because this had \\nbeen coming out of an internal Communist Party think tank, this idea, and it was latched on to by \\nXi Jinping as similar to some of his other initiatives that we have seen before and since of \\nrejuvenating China and bigger, more ambitious programs. \\n\\nIt certainly has become something that is--that the bureaucracy has very much \\nrallied around. China, which is the country that invented bureaucracy, knows how to get a \\nprogram passed, and so now every agency of government, as well as state-owned enterprise, in \\nChina has their own internal Belt and Road commission internally to figure out how they can get \\na project passed, subsidies gained, and call it Belt and Road.  So it's a very amorphous piece. \\n\\nIf you look at the mission statement--it's beautiful--that China has for Belt and \\nRoad Initiative, it talks a lot about win-win cooperation, which we see in a lot of other elements \\nof China's foreign policy.  This is something that on the ground in Beijing we like to say that \\nmeans China wins twice, but it's--we semi-morbidly joke with our Chinese counterparts on that.  \\nBut sometimes it feels that way.  But it's a beautiful mission statement. \\n\\nBut really if you look at what drove this program for Xi Jinping to put forward, I \\nwould say there's five or six key things that need to be addressed. \\n\\nFirst, the timing of it.  It was certainly coming on the heels of the U.S. pivot to \\nAsia, and there was genuine concern on the ground in Beijing at that time of what was this going \\nto mean.  At that time, we were talking about TPP and TTIP as trade initiatives to be sort of the \\neconomic ballast of the military pivot to Asia, and so the ground was fertile for a Chinese \\ninitiative in this regard to try to compete in a sense on that.  And certainly there is the need for \\nthe infrastructure spend, as has been noted, but it also--this was going to be somewhat of an \\nanswer to that. \\n\\nI'd also say that China likes, particularly Xi Jinping, his style of leadership--the \\nU.S. has always been given, and appropriately so, a lot of credit for the Marshall Plan after \\nWorld War II.  That is something that has come up a number of times in discussion with Chinese \\nofficials, and so this was an idea to be even bigger than the Marshall Plan, in a sense to make that \\nkind of impact.  And that appeals to Xi Jinping's style of leadership.   \\n\\nOf course, it was mentioned, another factor here is China's overcapacity issue, \\nparticularly in infrastructure-related materials and industries.  This is certainly a way.  I think \\neconomists can argue over exactly how much they can export of that overcapacity.  That's \\ncertainly one area that is appealing to China. \\n\\nA third, I mentioned this with the Xi Jinping's style of leadership.  This has taken \\nthe entire Chinese bureaucracy to a whole new level.  Under Deng Xiaoping, they were very \\nmuch following his policy guidance of \\\"hide your capabilities and bide your time.\\\" \\n\\nXi Jinping has completely discarded that, and you saw that now memorialized in \\nthe 19th Party Congress Constitution that was just passed.  This is a key part of this, along with \\n\\n3838\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nMade in China 2025 and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation are key aspects of him having \\nChina stand up and, as he said in the Party Congress this year, \\\"standing tall in the East.\\\"  This is \\na key part of that. \\n One other thing, and I find this a little bit morbidly of interest because of my \\nprevious government days, every time I do a briefing on Belt and Road Initiative, at least the \\nmaritime aspect of this, I'm reminded of about 13 years ago in my old job at Langley of finding a \\ndocument of the PLA's desire to build a string of pearls of bases out to various places.  The \\nMaritime Silk Road looks remarkably similar to that.  So I find that to be of interest. \\n The fifth thing I would point out, the Belt and Road Initiative certainly fulfills a \\ndomestic need for China, particularly out in the western regions of China, in Xinjiang, Qinghai, \\nand Tibet as well, to be able to try to build out some of the infrastructure there as key instruments \\nheading out to Central Asia.  They find that domestically quite appealing. \\n And then I think you can't look at this thing in separation from--I believe it's been \\nnoted earlier--of China's other key industrial policies, particularly Made in China 2025.  These \\nhave to be seen together--Belt and Road Initiative and that--because it's a part of how China is, in \\ntheir own terminology, seeking the commanding heights of key industries and certainly the soft \\npower projection to be able to build on their objectives of again having China be predominant, \\ncertainly in the region and a region that they consider critical to themselves. \\n I would just add one or two other things. I think that you have to look at, you \\nknow, how is this thing going to work or will it work?  As Jonathan pointed out a minute ago, I \\nthink there's some real risks in here.  Certainly you're seeing a bit of that already in Sri Lanka \\nand Myanmar of some pushback when sovereignty or perceived national slights are at play, and \\nthere's a lot of risk in this to be able to perhaps tip over on some of these sensitivities if China \\ndoesn't play its hand right. \\n On the other hand, I'm reminded of Ross Perot's comment in 1992 about the \\n\\\"giant sucking sound\\\" of the dollar heading down to Mexico if NAFTA is passed.  There is the \\ngiant sucking sound of the renminbi heading out to many places. \\n And while the United States and a number of other developed countries are \\nparticularly worried, and rightfully so, about the transparency of this program, of will there be \\nshared benefits, will it live up to the hype, will there be shared access, when you're--if you look \\nat the number of the recipient countries on the developing countryside, they're happy to see the \\ncash come in. \\n And unless there is, as Commissioner Shea mentioned, unless there is some \\ncompetition from somewhere else, it's an open door.  So at this point, they're happy to receive it.  \\nAnd if you look at--the final point I'd make on this--if you look at the Belt and Road Initiative \\nForum that--we called it BARF--in Beijing, again a little morbid humor--last May, to be able to \\nget 29 foreign leaders on relatively short notice for an international forum along with several \\ndozen ministerial level delegations to come to Beijing, that shows the power of that giant sucking \\nsound of the renminbi. \\n I'll leave it there.  Thank you. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3939\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF RANDAL PHILLIPS \\nMANAGING PARTNER, MINTZ GROUP \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4040\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nChina\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \\nPanel I:  Mercantilism with Chinese Characteristics:  Creating Markets and \\n\\nCultivating Influence \\n\\nTestimony before the U.S. \\u2013 China Economic and Security Review Commission \\n\\nRandal Phillips, Managing Partner for Asia, Mintz Group \\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\nIn the fall of 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the strategic conception \\nof building the \\u201cSilk Road Economic Belt\\u201d and the \\u201c21st Century Maritime Silk Road,\\u201d \\nknown shortly as the \\u201cOne Belt and One Road\\u201d (OBOR) initiatives.  Interestingly, this \\ninitiative when announced was very much a top down exercise, an idea that caught \\nXi\\u2019s eye from within policy research elements of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) \\nand put forth with relatively little input from below.  Much of the Chinese government \\nbureaucracy that would have to support it found themselves having to scramble to \\nfigure out exactly what Xi meant by this, and what the scale and scope of effort needed \\nwould be to support it.  Given the direct linkage to Xi as a signature policy, the Chinese \\nbureaucracy proceeded to rally quickly to flesh this out and it has subsequently \\nbecome a cause too big to fail in the Chinese system. \\n\\nChina\\u2019s official mission statement for OBOR is:  \\u201cThe idea carries forward the spirit of \\nthe ancient Silk Road that was based on mutual trust, equality and mutual benefits, \\ninclusiveness and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation.  It also conforms to the \\n21st century norms of promoting peace, development, cooperation and adopting a \\nwin-win strategy for all.  The conception organically links the \\u201cChinese dream\\u201d to the \\n\\u201cGlobal dream\\u201d and has far-reaching strategic significance with a global impact.\\u201d \\n\\nAs mission statements go, that does a great job of capturing all the catch phrases of \\nrecent propaganda efforts by the CCP under Xi\\u2019s leadership, but doesn\\u2019t capture fully \\nthe motivations behind this effort.  There are several drivers of this policy that must \\nbe fully appreciated to understand why this is of such import to the Chinese \\nleadership.  These include: \\n\\n1. At the time of the announcement of the OBOR policy, China was wrestling\\nwith its desired response to the U.S. \\u201crebalance to Asia,\\u201d and in particular\\nits economic component the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).  Taken\\ntogether with the effort by the Obama administration to pursue a similar\\nfree trade initiative with Europe (TTIP), China saw the need to present\\nalternative rules and regimes for the future.  The relatively vacant space of\\ninfrastructure spending provided a ready-made and relatively benign path\\nto do so.\\n\\n2. The Chinese leadership under Xi Jinping has recognized the need to deal\\nwith \\u201csupply side\\u201d issues of overcapacity, as well as excess foreign\\n\\n41Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nexchange reserves, and an initiative such as this provides a channel to \\naddress these issues to China\\u2019s benefit. \\n\\n3. A central issue to Xi Jinping is the \\u201crejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\\u201d\\nwhich essentially means having China play a much more active and central\\nrole in world affairs than that which had been pursued previously under\\nDeng Xiaoping\\u2019s dictum to hide capabilities and bide time.  Xi sees OBOR as\\nan ideal political and economic platform on which to boost China\\u2019s\\ninternational position and image, something greater in scope and ambition\\nto the U.S. Marshall Plan after World War II and hard to oppose on the face\\nof the policy given the infrastructure demand in the regions involved.  The\\nlack of specific target dates for completion of any initiatives also allows the\\nChinese leadership to declare success as it sees fit and not be bound to any\\nhard deadlines.\\n\\n4. The maritime \\u201croad\\u201d portion of the plan firmly plays to China\\u2019s desire to\\nbuild the infrastructure and capacity to diversify its energy supplies and\\nreduce the risk of being \\u201cstrangled\\u201d in the Straits of Malacca in a conflict\\nsituation.  This matches concerns reflected in internal People\\u2019s Liberation\\nArmy (PLA) planning documents dating back over a decade looking to\\npromote energy transmission routes through Burma, potentially building\\na canal through the Carat Isthmus in Thailand, and ports in Pakistan, Sri\\nLanka and beyond.\\n\\n5. It remains a high priority of the Chinese leadership to more fully develop\\nthe western regions of China, for economic as well as domestic stability\\nreasons.  This means that Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Yunnan are likely\\nto receive a disproportionate amount of funding and attention in the\\nlifespan of this initiative, something certainly welcome to those regions but \\nalso a driver for major foreign and domestic investment decisions.\\n\\n6. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the ramifications of OBOR must be\\nassessed together with China\\u2019s massive industrial policy initiative \\u201cMade\\nin China 2025.\\u201d  Launched in 2015, this policy seeks to make China the\\nworld leader in 10 critical categories of the economy that are on the cutting \\nedge of 21st century industries.  In that regard, China has launched the\\nequivalent of 10 Manhattan Project-style initiatives to \\u201cgain the\\ncommanding heights\\u201d in these sectors, driving large scale investment\\ndecisions and setting clear market access restrictions.  Just the scale of the\\neffort, let alone the degree to which China is successful, will heavily\\ninfluence world markets in key sectors and be a major player in China\\u2019s\\neconomic relations worldwide.\\n\\nAs has been seen in increasingly glowing government and CCP pronouncements since \\nNovember 2013, capped off by OBOR\\u2019s enshrinement in the CCP Constitution at the \\n19th Party Congress in October 2017, this initiative is a centerpiece for Xi\\u2019s economic \\nand foreign policies and thus will receive the benefit of the entirety of the PRC\\u2019s \\nbureaucratic and corporate backing.  It is too big to fail, and at least as long as Xi is \\naround, it won\\u2019t be allowed to fail.  The front lines of support are provided by China\\u2019s \\nrecently established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a thus far \\n\\n42Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nseemingly well functioning new multilateral institution that serves as a showpiece for \\nChina\\u2019s evolving pursuit of an alternative global construct.  While up and running in \\nrelatively short order, however, the AIIB\\u2019s importance in financing OBOR, at least thus \\nfar, is far outshone in terms of scope by China Development Bank (CDB) and China \\nExport-Import Bank (China Ex-Im).  It\\u2019s precisely the central role of these institutions \\nthat is troubling to U.S. and other foreign officials \\u2013 and companies seeking to get \\ninvolved - given the very limited transparency in operations they provide, and the \\nclear role they play in advancing China\\u2019s economic interests.  CDB and China Ex-Im \\nare able to act above the fray in China\\u2019s bureaucracy, and continue to effectively rebuff \\nefforts by foreign governments and entities alike to gain insight into their compliance \\nand decision-making processes. \\n\\nOne must tip their hat to the country that invented bureaucracy, as China has fully \\nharnessed its government departments, domestic state-owned enterprises, and \\nmajor \\u201cprivate\\u201d multinationals to all recognize the benefit (and essentially the \\nnecessity) to create their own OBOR policies as a priority and pursue it accordingly. \\nEntities are falling all over themselves to declare their support for OBOR and create \\nunits within their respective organizations to drive projects labeled as dedicated to \\nOBOR\\u2019s success and show their fealty to this policy.  It\\u2019s not only politically correct, \\nbut good business. That mindset has transcended to most multinational corporations, \\nincluding many U.S. firms, who also go out of their way to inform their PRC \\ninterlocutors \\u2013 especially SOE\\u2019s - that they, too, have created OBOR teams in their \\nentities to help guide their approach to the PRC market and beyond. \\n\\nAs a recent analytical assessment produced by the Conference Board stated, OBOR is \\nclearly an ambitious platform for China to try to soak up at least a good portion of its \\nacute industrial overcapacity and support growth for distressed state industry.  It is \\narguably China\\u2019s most audacious effort yet to try to engineer growth, and reaffirms \\nthe grip and control China\\u2019s government has over major assets in the economy, as \\nwell as the socioeconomic imperative to keep them producing.  It also illustrates the \\nleadership\\u2019s lack of progress, at least thus far, in migrating growth drivers away from \\nstate-financed investment toward household consumption.  Finally, OBOR represents \\nan intervention and deployment of central government funds that flies in the face of \\nthe celebrated November 2013 CCP Third Plenum promise to let markets play a \\ndecisive role in China\\u2019s economy going forward. \\n\\nThis past year has been pivotal in trying to assess what\\u2019s real and what\\u2019s hype with \\nOBOR.  Many corporate executives, trade diplomats and China watchers worldwide \\nwatched in awe \\u2013 well-founded skepticism but yet awestruck \\u2013 as Xi Jinping \\naddressed the World Economic Forum in January 2017 extolling the virtues of \\nglobalization, openness, connectivity and a free and fair trading order.  These were \\npeople well steeped in the effects of China\\u2019s highly protectionist policies at home, thus \\nfinding it amazing that they were listening to Xi\\u2019s anti-protectionist rhetoric abroad \\nand wondering if the world had been turned on its head given the positive reception \\nhe received.  This is magnified by the fact that the vast majority of US and European \\nobservers involved in the region believe that China under Xi has been closing, rather \\n\\n43Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nthan opening, doors to trade and investment, and accelerating on a path towards \\nisolation, insulation, illiberalism and more government controls. \\n\\nOn the other hand, one must also look at the success China achieved with the May \\n2017 Belt and Road Forum on International Cooperation in Beijing, seeming to \\nindicate that much of the global community may have a different, and more \\nwelcoming, perspective on China\\u2019s vision and role in the world.  The turnout speaks \\nfor itself \\u2013 twenty-nine heads of state and several dozen other ministerial-level \\nnational delegations \\u2013 all coming to Beijing on relatively short notice compared to the \\nnorms of international conference planning.  Though the officially stated results and \\njoint communiqu\\u00e9 issued from the conference was not earth-shattering in \\nsignificance, it would be hard to point to another gathering drawing such firepower \\nin comparison to what Xi Jinping was able to draw to Beijing.   \\n\\nSomewhat akin to what U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot famously stated in \\n1992 about the \\u201cgiant sucking sound\\u201d of investment flows to Mexico should NAFTA \\npass, the enticement of RMB flows to recipient countries in the OBOR path is at least \\nas real.  While advanced economies have tended to focus on China\\u2019s perceived desire \\nto alter global norms, its paranoia about information and data flows, its lack of \\nreciprocity in trade and investment policies, its internet firewall and increased \\nobsession with national security \\u2013 all understandable and legitimate concerns \\u2013 the \\nBelt and Road Forum attendees mostly from developing countries all demonstrated \\nthrough their attendance that they are not overly concerned about any of these issues. \\nThis is music to the ears of Xi and the Chinese leadership, particularly as codified in \\nthe recent CCP 19th Party Congress official documentation that China should seek to \\nbe seen as a credible leader for 21st century globalization.  In this view China is \\nessentially offering ups its blend of state capitalism, socialist market economy, \\nauthoritarian political control, and new multilateral institutions as a new path for \\ncountries to consider and the possible backbone of a new international order.  Given \\nthat most of the OBOR interested nations are highly protectionist with state-led \\neconomies in their own right, this is not a hard sell for China.   \\n\\nThe net effect of these views is that there is an effective dividing line between \\ndeveloped and developing nations in their outlook on OBOR. Essentially there is a \\nbattle between those concerned over changing China\\u2019s behavior on an ample number \\nof trade, investment and governance issues, and those relatively unfazed by this and \\ninstead focused on scrambling for the cash.  China is betting on the latter side winning, \\nand is being quite transparent in its position and confident in its ascendancy.  There \\nis every reason to believe based on the record of the past five years of Xi\\u2019s leadership, \\nthe priorities he ensured were endorsed at the 19th Party Congress, and the very \\npublic pronouncements being issued to \\u201cgrasp the historic opportunity,\\u201d that China \\nunder Xi will not liberalize in the manner that most Western audiences had hoped or \\nexpected.  The good news, at least to those who are worrying about China\\u2019s perceived \\nambitions to change the global order, is that China\\u2019s actions thus far point to a more \\nregional rather than global scope.  This is certainly true in Eurasia and parts of Africa. \\nChina has laid down a marker that it is the leading driver of developmental policy in \\n\\n44Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nthese regions, and is increasingly expecting other nations and existing multilateral \\ninstitutions to acknowledge this. \\n\\nSo what should multinational companies expect from China\\u2019s OBOR \\ninitiative?   \\n\\nThe first thing that needs to be recognized is that OBOR does not provide a level \\nplaying field for Western MNC\\u2019s to compete with Chinese firms.  It is plain and simple \\nan instrument of China\\u2019s political and economic growth and manifestation of the \\nopportunity Xi Jinping sees for China to take center stage in the world.  That said, \\nthere are, and will be, quite a number of opportunities for foreign businesses to \\nparticipate in the \\u201cbest supporting actor\\u201d category.  We are seeing this on the ground \\nin Beijing and Shanghai among numerous U.S. multinationals that are eager to carve \\nout opportunities.  The net effect thus far, and likely for the foreseeable future, is for \\ncompanies to play sub-contracting roles to leading Chinese enterprises, particularly \\nin the services sector such as commercial insurance, consulting, logistics, technical \\nservices provision, etc.  Many Chinese firms are bidding on OBOR-related contracts \\nfully knowledgeable that they do not possess the complete expertise in house to carry \\nout the project, but rather will have to subcontract many aspects to foreign firms, \\nknowing that OBOR is much like an affirmative action policy to benefit Chinese \\nenterprise in the leading roles.  While this limited role for foreign enterprises is on its \\nface distorted and a tilted playing field, a number of analysts assess that this may turn \\nout to be a good thing given the high risk, low economic return of the vast majority of \\nOBOR projects to date.  As has been seen in so many other areas of Chinese economic \\npolicy, the rate of return is much less important that the perceived or real political \\nand diplomatic benefits China is seeking.  This is why CDB and China Ex-Im, by far the \\ntwo leading financers of OBOR, are not particularly concerned in moving forward on \\ntheir projects while private sector entities are taking a comparatively more cautious \\napproach. \\n\\nSo will it work?  Like most things, it depends on how you define success.  As a political \\nand soft power initiative, it has already proven quite beneficial to China, and is likely \\nto continue on that path unless China unduly overplays its hand or stumbles into \\nscenarios where host sovereignty sensitivities are tweaked.  That\\u2019s a very real \\npotential outcome in such a grandiose project, but China at least to date has gone to \\ngreat lengths to try to ameliorate these risks.  The financing and economic return \\naspects of OBOR are likely to be the most challenging, and even with China\\u2019s very large \\nforeign exchange reserves and firm political commitment its hard to see China being \\nable to bear the brunt of this financing any more than a decade out, if even close to \\nthat amount of time.  The policy is directly tied to Xi Jinping personally, and since he\\u2019s \\nnow enshrined to be China\\u2019s paramount leader barring upheaval until he goes off to \\nmeet Marx, there is every reason to believe that the PRC will do everything possible \\nto sustain this policy.  \\n\\n45Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPANEL I QUESTION AND ANSWER \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you very much. \\nAnd now I know we each have a number of questions, and Commissioner Shea, \\n\\nwhy don't you start off? \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Well, thank you to all three of you.  Very, very \\n\\ninteresting testimony. \\nI want to just begin with Ms. Rolland.  I want to congratulate you on your book.  \\n\\nIt's really brilliant and highly readable, which I particularly appreciate.  So it's really good.  \\nBut you asked a question in the title of your book, and I want you to answer this \\n\\nat some point today.  You say it's called \\\"China's Eurasian Century,\\\" and then you put question \\nmark.  So I want you to answer that question mark at some point during your testimony. \\n\\nBut my question is about--I think Mr. Phillips and Mr. Hillman also alluded to \\nthis--that there's sort of a lockstep mentality in China about Belt and Road.  My experience is if \\nyou want to get money in China, if you're a think tank, you put the words \\\"Belt and Road\\\" on a \\nproject, and you get support. \\n\\nI'm wondering could you tell me what is the level of domestic criticism or \\ndomestic concern within China?  If everybody is speaking in one voice 100 percent, that's not \\nnecessarily a good thing.  I mean sometimes a little criticism leads to improvement.  Maybe we \\nhave too much criticism here in Washington and not enough improvement. \\n\\nBut in a system where everybody is walking in lockstep, it could lead to \\ndisastrous results.  So I was wondering if anybody could sort of tell me are there voices within \\nthe Chinese system that express reservations about Belt and Road or at least aspects of it?  \\nAnyone?   \\n\\nMR. PHILLIPS:  I'd be glad to make a few comments on that. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Sure. \\nMR. PHILLIPS:  Not yet or not, none that we have seen as of yet.  And I would \\n\\nsay it's early days as I think you mentioned earlier.  Certainly you look at the SOEs and actually \\nmany private sector companies in China, they've all put together for the reasons you pointed out \\ntheir own Belt and Road committees.  \\n\\nCertainly in the early days of the Belt and Road Initiative when everybody was \\ntrying to figure out what this all was, you saw, particularly in Southeast Asia, a lot of the projects \\nthat were already underway or already investments anticipated being repurposed and called Belt \\nand Road Initiative, and as particularly state-owned enterprises went back for more funding or \\nwent to the China Development Bank or to Ex-Im, China Ex-Im Bank, it would be very useful to \\ncall it Belt and Road to be able to apply for those funds. \\n\\nI think if you just look at the total amount of actual executed funding so far for \\nBelt and Road Initiative, it's fairly, it's less than what was originally thought was going to be at \\nthis point, but it's still early days on it.  So I think at this point it's still very useful to a lot of the \\ncompanies. \\n\\nInternally, in the Party, they haven't really spent that much money on this yet.  \\nBut even with China's significant foreign exchange reserves and capabilities, with the other \\nproblems they're dealing with right now, if, depending on how the pace of these projects being \\nexecuted, those voices could raise in the coming few years if some other economic priorities start \\npressing. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Ms. Rolland. \\n\\n4646\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n MS. ROLLAND:  I think the voices of reservations are not publicly available, but \\nif you're talking with people, they might--some of them might have some reservations and think \\nthat maybe it's a bit too early for China to go out like this, and I think that some scholars have \\nsaid that there might be a risk of overstretch for China.  These are difficult countries that they're \\ngoing to invest in, and so what kind of economic return are they going to get? \\n And all the problems that we can see here, they can see them too, you know, \\nproblems with conflicts and not great economic returns and so on and so forth.  So, but the center \\nhas given the directions, and now they have to fulfil the vision and try to find ways to make it \\nhappen knowing that it's not going to be easy. \\n About \\\"China's Eurasian Century?\\\" I think it depends on us whether it's going to \\nbe a period or a question mark.  The title comes from, I think, as you could imagine, the balance \\nwith the Pacific century, and how maybe I think that China's dream is to re-become the central \\npower over Asia and Eurasia.  This is what the China Dream is all about. \\n And so if it's going to extend its influence over this continent, it might become \\nEurasian, its Eurasian century, and the Pacific century might become a thing of the past.  I don't \\nread in crystal balls.  I'm just saying-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay.  All right. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  --this is what they're trying to achieve. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  But your point is that it's up to us as to-- \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Absolutely.  That's my, that's my thinking, yes. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay.  Thank you. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Let me jump in on that.  Through the course of \\npreparation for this hearing, I have been thinking continuously about risk management and when \\neverything is this gigantic, be it a Marshall Plan or a moon shot, from the way we Westerners \\nthink of it, there is risk management going on heavily. \\n In China, I know their mindset is different, but--and you all keep saying we're at \\nthe early stage; we're at the early stage.  How are they going to from the Chinese mentality \\napproach this huge vision of theirs?  And I want to get concrete on risk management.  How is it \\nbeing done in the local company level? \\n And maybe, Randy, you could, since you've been on the ground there out in \\ndifferent provinces a lot, you could start off with that, but I'd like to hear from each of you. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you.  Chairman Tobin, thank you very much.    \\n And I mentioned, as Chairman Shea noted earlier, with the example of Pakistan \\nand the dangers there for Chinese workers or others, that situation is playing out in Africa and \\nother locations where the Belt and Road Initiative projects are already underway. \\n And I can tell you from a concrete sense what I've seen on the ground now for a \\ncouple of years.  Previously there wasn't much of an industry in China of think of it like \\nBlackwater-type \\ncompany to be able to provide security for Chinese companies abroad.  \\n Now there's a vibrant industry there, and there's been a lot of interest and \\ninteraction from Chinese officials, as well as state-owned enterprises and the private sector, in \\nthe last couple years reaching out to U.S. and others around the world to try to develop that \\nexpertise, realizing that as they project their investments out into more hostile environments, \\nthey're going to have to protect their workers. \\n And then it also plays out on the PLA side of capabilities to perhaps have to \\nevacuate and deal with those type of contingencies.  So there is avid debate as well as active \\n\\n4747\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthings going on on the ground in China to try to develop these capabilities to be able to help their \\nindustries. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n Mr. Hillman. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  So with some of the infrastructure projects we track, I think one \\nof the big contrasts between the Western approach is that a lot of the risk management is done up \\nfront before a project is started, and so that's often why it can be slower to start.  There are \\nstudies that are done.  You know, the China model is often faster and let's deal with the risks as \\nthey come up as we encounter them in the projects. \\n But I also think that, you know, more broadly a lot of our thinking sometimes \\nabout how China is executing these projects is probably three or so years out of date because I do \\nthink that there's learning that occurs.  You know they're not immune to criticism.  Criticism \\nthat's happened in Africa, I think, has impacted how they operate in Central Asia. \\n I think that there's a willingness to try to hire more local labor because of the \\npolitical risk if you don't do that.  I do think that there have been instances of holding up funding \\nbecause of corruption, including in Pakistan, you know, withholding funds. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Are you seeing them do those corrections? \\n MR. HILLMAN:  So, yes, but I think it's also these risks differ so dramatically in \\nall of the places that we're talking about.  So, yes, you know, generally, they're challenging \\nbusiness environments.  But the risks that you face--the security risks you face in western \\nPakistan is not the same that you face in Eastern Europe, and Belt and Road is so sprawling that I \\nthink it's very difficult to talk about these risks at that high level.  I think it's a really sort of \\ncountry-by-country framing. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Ms. Rolland. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Yes, thank you.   \\n I would totally agree with everything that's been just said.  I think for the security \\nof the Chinese assets and citizens, China is constrained by its noninterference policy right now.  \\nSo I think they're starting to think about how to get around this, and there are several ways that I \\ncan already see coming. \\n The first is the delocalization of the security.  So you put the burden of the \\nsecurity of your assets and citizens on the local military and security forces like what we've seen \\nin Pakistan.  We've seen it also in Ethiopia, for example.   \\n There is also increasingly, and Randal is right to point out to this, that private \\nsecurity companies--Chinese--that are very active now and getting more important.   \\n There is an increasing security cooperation bilaterally, and also we're starting to \\nsee emerging a sort of regional security cooperation with local countries and China so maybe an \\nemerging regional security framework really going on to tackle those risks as well. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n I know we have lots of questions.  Senator Talent. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  Thank you all.   \\n I'm going to make a statement and then follow with a question.  So when I look at \\nthis One Belt One Road, I'm just a poor old former public servant, you know.  I'm not an \\neconomist or anything else.  It looks to me like they're spending an awful lot of their money--I'm \\ntalking about the land bridges now--to build infrastructure in other countries.  That's what it \\nlooks like to me. \\n In other words, it's almost like a colonial power building roads in its colonies \\n\\n4848\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nexcept they don't have the colonies, and that didn't even work for the colonial powers really. \\n So what are the terms?  I mean they're not going to own these assets, right?  So \\nthat's the first thing.  They're not going to own them so they have to get, they have to have decent \\nterms on the loans, and the loans have to be paid, and you all have already commented on how \\nunstable the countries are.  So I'm looking at this and thinking, maybe more so than you guys are, \\nthat this is a loser for them on the land bridge stuff. \\n Now, Mr. Phillips, you said something about the maritime that I think is different \\nbecause there, it seems to me, they could end up getting a lot of really strategically important \\npoints under their control to protect their sea lanes. \\n So comment on both of that.  I mean is there a basis, do you think, as American \\npolicymakers consider this for distinguishing between the land bridges they're building and the \\nMaritime Silk Road in terms of how we ought to deal with it and what the implications are for \\nus?  And how can they expect the economics of these land bridges to work?  And how are they \\ngoing to get enough return on the Mongolian-Russian land bridge? What kind of markets do they \\nthink they're going to get out of that to justify an investment like that? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Senator. \\n I would certainly defer to my fellow panelists who have-- \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  Yeah.  I intended it for all three of you. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Excellent--the nuts and bolts of individual deals in a greater \\ndepth than I probably do, but I can tell you from all of the analysts I've spoken to on the ground \\nin China, I have yet to find one who thinks that this economically, that the returns on this are \\ngoing to be favorable. \\n But it's not seen as an economic win, at least not yet.  It could potentially turn into \\nthat, but it's much more of a soft power projection and a way to further build influence together \\nwith other major projects that China is doing with Made in China 2025 and the great \\nrejuvenation of the nation.  That's all packaged together. \\n Economically, more people can paint a case, just as you did, that it could be a \\nloser or at best break even than anything else.  I would say that when you look at the Maritime \\nversus the Road, technically the Road is the Maritime, and why they did that, I'll never know, but \\nI think a lot of people are looking geostrategically, and I would imagine some of the panels this \\nafternoon will talk about this. \\n At some point or another, it's going to come up against Russia's interests in \\nCentral Asia, and that's a real friction point that I think everybody is waiting to see how that \\nplays out. \\n Certainly in the sea portion, I've spent a lot of time in ASEAN doing briefings \\nactually on this issue, starting a couple of years ago, and everybody there is very mindful, \\nparticularly the Singaporeans, of what this all means for China's projection of force. \\n But at the same time they also see it as an economic opportunity so they're trying \\nto hedge each way, which is something that, of course, we're used to seeing.  But I think it most \\ndefinitely, as I mentioned earlier, with the PLA's wishes for a number of years now in \\ndeveloping plans for how they would like to be able to control supply lines and become much \\nmore of a blue water force, this fits perfectly into it. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  So I think there is no question that the overland component of \\nBelt and Road is the most ambitious part of what is already a very ambitious vision.  And that's \\nbecause for hundreds of years most commerce has traveled by the sea, right, and I don't, I \\npersonally don't think that this is going to really change that dramatically. \\n\\n4949\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n Something that we're looking into is the emergence of these new China-to-Europe \\nrail services, which it seems like every month there's a new, you know, from Chinese City A to \\nEuropean City B service that's announced.  But these are heavily subsidized routes, and the \\noptimistic projections of them have them doubling their share of trade between China and \\nEurope over the next decade.  So doubling sounds like a lot, but it's going from 1.25 percent to \\n2.5 percent. \\n And so if you're in the air freight business, you might be worried about that eating \\ninto the business that you do.  I think the maritime story remains where most of the action is, in \\nlarge part because of many of the challenges that you pointed out have been shown in colonial \\nhistory with building projects beyond your borders. \\n I think there's also, there's an American parallel too.  Next year is going to be the \\n150th anniversary of the Transcontinental Railway, which it included shady financing.  You \\nknow it led to an economic crisis.  The costs in many respects far exceeded the returns, and so I \\nthink that for all of these reasons, the maritime domain is probably where the real action remains. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  If you want to have, if you want to spread the financial risk, \\nyou ask others to help you finance those projects, and AIIB, for example, is doing just that.  You \\nare making others helping you finance those infrastructure projects because it's good for Asia.  \\nSo you spread the risk among everyone else.  You just, it's not just China taking the financial \\nburden.  That's one point. \\n If those countries can't repay their loans, then you seize their assets.  You ask \\nthem to give you a 99-year lease on your port or you ask them provide oil or gas for a number of \\nyears, for example.  That's another way to have some kind of economic return. \\n The land bridge--sorry-- \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  Sort of plays hell with the whole soft power thing, \\nthough, doesn't it? \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Absolutely. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  I mean it's not really the way to gain influence, \\nseizing assets and, you know, dictating terms.  It hasn't worked all that well for us either. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Absolutely.  Yeah, I am aware.   \\n About the land bridge, I think we should not just focus on the railways.  There are \\nalso pipelines and fiber-optic networks.  I think that's also very important to follow.  We have to \\nthink of it as a very comprehensive network and, you know, if you can control the Internet over \\nthat big area, you have a great advantage also.  It's not just the trains going full one direction and \\nback empty.  I think there's another dimension that we tend to forget. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  Thank you.  Yeah, the energy piece I should have \\nmentioned.  I get that as well.  Thank you. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n Commissioner Cleveland. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Good morning.  I'm glad I showed up just to hear \\nBARF.   \\n [Laughter.] \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  So I think I'm going to submit questions about \\nyour pie chart, Mr. Hillman, for the record and ask for a breakdown of what you benchmarked in \\nterms of the MDBs versus the Chinese Policy Bank investments.  I'd be curious as to what's \\nbehind that. \\n But I don't know that that lends itself to a conversation right now other than could \\n\\n5050\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nyou--any of you--describe in terms of the commercial loans that have been characterized as key \\nto the Chinese Policy Bank lending, what's the range on that?  It's obviously not IDA terms of \\nseven years before you have to start paying back any loan and then potential forgiveness at the \\nend of 21.  What is the nature of the commercial--what is the commercial nature of the loans, and \\ndoes it vary by country; does it vary by type of project?  Do you have any sort of knowledge on \\nthat?  For any of you--sorry.  Yeah. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Yeah.  Thank you.  So happy to provide some further detail on \\nsome of the project comparisons that we've done with multilateral development banks versus \\nChinese-funded projects. \\n I think with some of the terms I think it does vary.  I think one of the differences, \\nso about three-quarters of Chinese official finance is commercial terms.  So it's going to be \\nhigher interest rates than you would get.  You know, it's not concessional financing like you \\nwould get from an MDB.  So I think there's a difference between the rates.  They're often able to \\ndo that, though, because they're willing to go where those other lenders are not, and I think that's \\nsomething we need to think about because we can criticize and illuminate the risks of pursuing \\nrisky projects, but until you provide better alternatives, I think it's very difficult to persuade \\nsomeone. \\n I mean just put yourself in the shoes of someone considering those offers.  On the \\none hand, you have a project that can start tomorrow that you can announce and have a \\ngroundbreaking ceremony, and, on the other hand, you have warnings about, you know, longer-\\nterm risks.  And I think that we need to think more about providing some better alternatives. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Okay.  Well, presumably that's one of the things \\none hopes that the international institutions step into that, that gap-- \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Certainly. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  --where other people won't want to go.  Maybe if \\nyou could provide some kind of chart that sort of shows, and when it comes to road construction, \\nthis is the kind of loan rate that they're offering over what period of time and what other terms \\nmay be related to it, and if it varies by sector, if it varies by country, I'd be curious about what we \\nknow.  And it may not; it may not be much. \\n The second piece of this that I'm really interested in, and it was referenced in a \\nstaff memo, and I think in some of your testimony, is that this is as much an initiative about \\nforeign policy and international security interests for China, but it is also very much about \\ndomestic drivers. \\n And I think it was characterized somewhere that every province has a stake in this \\ninitiative. So I'm wondering if you all could speak to what that provincial stake is?  Is it anteing \\nup money? Is it an expectation of employment?  Is it skills, expertise?  Kind of what is the \\nprovincial interest or commitment? \\n And then the other piece of it is thinking back to the last time there was an \\ninternal stimulus in China, it ended up being a tax on the provinces because they had to cough up \\nmoney to cover a lot of what the domestic spending expectations were.  So, again, in that \\ncontext, are they, are they being asked to commit or are they seeing this an opportunity?  How \\nwould you characterize the provincial piece of this? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  I'll just make a couple comments on this.  Commissioner \\nCleveland, if I could return just briefly to your previous question, I just wanted to add, I know \\nthis is the point of what are the terms of the deals and sort of it harkens to a more broader issue \\nabout the transparency of the deals.  I know it's a point of frustration for a number of us on the \\n\\n5151\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nground in Beijing to include folks at our embassy there and other embassies who have tried to \\nlook into this to understand better how their companies might compete. \\n There's, what we're seeing is almost a two-tier situation.  On the one hand, you \\nhave AIIB, which is by all indications operating quite well and by multinational standards and \\nChina's intense work, and Jin Liqun is very well respected head of that organization.  They've \\nhired good people, and it's out there to be seen as the showpiece of this. \\n The problem is-- \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  As you note, it's not competitive when you look at \\nit dollar for dollar, as to what the-- \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Dollar for dollar, you're absolutely right. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  I mean it's relatively small in terms of what they've \\ninvested in. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Exactly.  But from a transparency and how they're operating-- \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Right. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  --so far so good.  The problem is most of the money is coming \\nout of China Development Bank and China Ex-Im, and it's incredibly frustrating for a lot of \\npeople on the ground to try to get insight into how these deals are being done across the board. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Maybe there's a chart that somebody could \\nproduce that shows all of the deals and whether or not there is transparency because sometimes \\nthe lack of information when it's made public is-- \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Absolutely. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  --useful.  So-- \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  I think the transparency part of this is critical, and I mean it's a \\nhuge challenge for researchers, but it's a practical challenge too for people who want to \\nparticipate in these projects. \\n So we have, on our website, we have a page for each project that we track, and \\nthere's a number of data fields on each project page.  So as an experiment, one of the things we \\ndid was we basically gave each page a report card, how much information do you have, and it \\nwas a little bit surprising.  We actually, the Chinese lenders and the MDBs came out all sort of in \\nthe B to B minus category. \\n But I think it's very difficult to know about the things that you're not aware of; \\nright?  And so a trend that we have observed is that some of the China Development Bank \\nprojects, in particular, that we have, we don't know about them when they're in their earliest \\nstages.  We know about them when they're further along, and the earlier stages is where the \\nopportunities are to sort of become involved. \\n And it's also the opportunity to know what the terms are and to do your due \\ndiligence on that. So I think the transparency issue is key and hopefully something that, you \\nknow, those institutions will improve on and something we should ask them to improve on as \\nwell. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Provincial issue? \\n MS. ROLLAND:  I'm not so familiar with the financial burden that the provinces \\nhave to take on because of that.  But from the central government perspective, the idea is really \\nto try to reduce the development gap between the coastal provinces that are more developed and \\nthe landlocked ones, some sort of prolongation of what happened around the 2000s when they \\nstarted to implement the Greater Western Development Plan. \\n\\n5252\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n So now the idea is that instead of having development coming from the eastern \\nshores down to the landlocked provinces, those provinces would be sandwiched between eastern \\ncoast and the entire region, and cross-border trade would also help them growing their own, their \\nown economy and so on.  \\n So reducing the developing gap.  Those provinces have also an increasing--that's \\ninteresting--an increasing role in foreign policy as well.  So, for example, Xinjiang is a dedicated \\nprovince to try to develop ties with the Turkic world, so Central Asia but also Turkey.   \\n Ningxia, which is a Muslim province, has lots of ties with the Gulf countries, for \\nexample, building on this identity of Muslim world.  The southern provinces of Yunnan and \\nGuangxi also have more dedicated ties with Southeast Asia, for example.  So you can see that \\nthey are sort of specializing into building more ties with their closer neighbors, and that's also an \\ninteresting thing to follow. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  A couple of things to say.  Mr. Hillman \\nmentioned his database, and for those of you online or in the audience, this is at the CSIS \\nwebsite, and it's called Reconnecting Asia; am I right? \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Uh-huh. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  So do take a look at that, and it sounds like you \\ncan build in even more along the lines of what our new chairman, Chairman Cleveland, is \\nthinking.  And our vice chairperson is Carolyn Bartholomew.  Left me shift to hear your \\nquestions. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Thank you very much, and thank you to \\nall of our witnesses both for being here today and for your service for your respective \\ngovernments over the years.  We think we've all benefited from that. \\n I just want to note that this is clearly an important issue and one we're going to \\nkeep talking about.  Our ranks up here are a little depleted today.  We have two people, two \\ncommissioners on the disabled list, and one whose flight was canceled first thing this morning.  \\nOtherwise we would have a more fulsome participation. \\nA couple of things.  One is can you talk a little bit about what you think Beijing--what \\nconstitutes success for Beijing of this Belt and Road Initiative?  I'll just say also while we ask \\nyou to focus on Belt and Road, it's very difficult for me to look at any of this without also \\nthinking about China's moves in Africa and in Latin America. That it's all part of the \\\"going out\\\" \\nstrategy or whatever we call it.  So there's a piece of it, but I have a tendency to think of these \\nother filters. That's one thing. \\n Another is I know, Mr. Phillips, you talked particularly about cash, but what \\nabout the debt, the debt loads that the countries who are getting these projects are going to be \\nfacing?  When we were in Hanoi a couple of years ago, you know, we heard a lot of complaint \\nabout projects already behind schedule, over budget, which meant the debt burden was going to \\nincrease, and being poorly made. \\n So what I'd like to think about, again, what constitutes success for Beijing in these \\nprojects, but also what are the implications for the countries who are the recipients?  And we'll \\ntie in there--Ms. Rolland, I'm glad you mentioned the fiber optics issues because, of course, \\nthere's a very real possibility that China's Great Firewall is ultimately what succeeds or \\nessentially is extended or implemented in all of these other countries, which reduces the ability \\nof the people in those countries to raise questions about how their leaders are dealing with China.  \\nIn fact, we'll go into some of the geostrategic things that were things.  \\n So I'm trying to look at it from both levels that, what, by 2049, what would a \\n\\n5353\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nsuccessful BRI look like?  Even by 2025, what would it look like?  And what are the \\nimplications for the countries, the challenges that they're facing?  Is this just another new \\ncolonialism? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  Thank you very much for those questions, and particularly \\nto your first point, what is success has been something in the front of my mind from the very \\nbeginning of this.  I think this is such a beautiful political program that it's beyond belief.  Why?  \\nBecause you can define success any way you want.  There's no end date; there's no target dates.   \\n Arguably, Beijing could say today that's successful, and it is for many of the \\nreasons we've talked about already of just the ability to bring those many, that many leaders to \\nBeijing in May and national level delegations and have the ability for Chinese firms to have the \\nextension and the development of soft power they already have is arguably success. \\n So the beauty of it is there is no end target date.  There is no hard and fast \\nobjective or criteria that anybody can really lay on this to say did you meet what you said you \\nwere going to do or not because they haven't really said what they're going to do. \\n Now your point about the debt is I think as critical.  I think it's been pointed out \\nearlier that there are some real land mines in that and problems that some places are already \\nexperiencing. Look at Sri Lanka, for example.  Just some of the projects that weren't even called \\nBelt and Road before that are sort of that now have already caused debt issues that become \\npolitical problems internally and then become a bilateral issue with China, and then it's going to \\ndepend on how China reacts to that. \\n Do they seize assets?  Do they try to come out with more concessionary terms?  I \\nthink that's, that's one of the real areas to watch as this unfolds. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Thank you. \\n So Sri Lanka was just mentioned, and I think it's a fascinating case of both some \\nof the rewards for China even when things go wrong, and so, you know, in the southern part of \\nSri Lanka, which I had an opportunity to visit just a few weeks ago, there's a port at Hambantota \\nthat we're probably all familiar with that was built by Chinese contractors with Chinese \\nfinancing, and then when the government couldn't pay back the loan, China took equity in the \\nport.  They now have a 99-year lease, and this is in a very strategic area of the world that's, you \\nknow, miles from some of the busiest shipping lanes. \\n And if you go there today, it's, you know, kind of on lockdown.  It's been handed \\nover to Chinese companies to run, but there's not a lot of economic activity there, and it's a \\ndramatic contrast.  It's like night and day between that port and the port in Colombo where there \\nis lots of, you know, cargo vessels coming in and out. \\n In Hambantota, you can look into the Indian Ocean and see large vessels going by \\nin the distance, but none of them are coming in, and I think that's not going to be great for Sri \\nLanka in the longer term because, you know, this was sold as a development program for an area \\nthat had been hit by a natural disaster, for an area that had been traditionally undeveloped. \\n And I think we also need to be careful about how we respond to this now that it \\nhas happened so there are proposals to develop yet another port in Sri Lanka on the eastern side \\nin Trincomalee, and this is a, I mean naturally there's World War II history there, naturally a very \\nbeautiful port, and there's interest among some outside countries--Japan and India among them--\\nin maybe developing that. \\n From a debt perspective, that might make the problem worse for Sri Lanka unless \\nit's done in the right way.  And so I think we need to be, we need to be careful that as this \\ncompetition continues, these debt issues are handled correctly, and that we're not by trying to fix \\n\\n5454\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthe problem adding, you know, even more, even more debt to a small economy. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  There's a word that has come back in several of the \\ncommissioners' comments this morning.  It's colonialism.  I think we tend to see what China is \\ndoing through our own lenses and through our own experience.  I think in Beijing's eyes, it's not \\nabout colonialism.  It's about \\\"all under heavens.\\\"  \\n I was struck when I was doing my research about this project about how \\neverything goes back to historical references to maybe a mythical past really, a mythical history \\nwhere China was, you know, the empire was respected by its neighbors and had some diplomatic \\nties with the region, going also through the tributary system. \\n Some scholars in China and the strategic thinkers frankly refer to that past when \\nthey talk about Belt and Road.  So, and people tend to be very skeptical about that.  Who would \\nwant to be a vessel state to China nowadays in 21st century?  How is this possible?  It's a myth. \\n I think we're starting actually to see this already.  So the Belt and Road Forum, \\nthe famous BARF, that we all like a lot, I think was a very, very symbolic of that sort of tributary \\nsystem.  People didn't kowtow and didn't put their head on the floor in front of Xi Jinping, but \\nthey came with gifts, MOUs, and in return for that, they got access.  They got investment.  They \\ngot protection. \\n I think this is the kind of mindset that you need to think about when you're \\nthinking about Belt and Road.  It's a different--it's a different thing that we're looking at.  Again, \\nit's foreign, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't work. \\n If you look also at companies, big companies that are being silenced on the fact \\nthat they cannot write Taiwan as a country on their website or whatever, that's also part of, I \\nthink, a 21st century \\\"all under heaven\\\" system.  So I think the vision and what constitutes \\nsuccess for Beijing, as Randal Phillips said, it's already happening.  It's already successful.  \\nPeople are paying attention.  China's image, global image, is really enhanced. \\n This is a fantastic project and people are talking about it.  There's no leader \\naround the world that is not paying attention to China's proposal and starting to think about how \\nthey can get some benefit from it.  Just that--just that is very important. \\n So in the end, I think the vision is also a reflection of China's uneasiness with the \\ncurrent international order.  More and more the Chinese authorities are vocal about how the \\ncurrent order is just U.S.-led and Western-led, and it's unfair to other countries, and China needs \\nto do more to transform it and to reform it so that China and the developing world has more say, \\nwhich brings me back to the digital Silk Road and how this is going to have a geopolitical \\nimpact. \\n There, too, I think the physical infrastructure is just part of what Belt and Road is \\nabout.  So you might have fiber optic networks around the region that are laid by Chinese \\ncompanies that in itself has to be under scrutiny on our side.  But it's also about the narrative that \\nthose networks project to the outside.   \\n There's more and more media cooperation between China and Russia and Iran, et \\ncetera, et cetera.  Those civilians' skills that China has implemented inside and domestically can \\nalso be exported outside, and Commissioner Bartholomew, you said something about the Great \\nFirewall.  There is, I think, a strong possibility that those skills are going to be exported also \\naround the region.   \\n And this is also part of what China has been trying to enhance for itself, which is \\nwhat it calls the discursive power.  China needs to make its voice heard and listened to by other \\ncountries, and Belt and Road has provided China with just that.  I think we're hearing China's \\n\\n5555\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nvoice more than ever before. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  If I could just add one piece on that.  I think this is very \\nimportant whether it's on the fiber optic side or any of the other industries of the Made in China \\n2025 industrial policy, which is basically, as you all know, ten broad categories of industry that \\nare at the heart of 21st century economy, the economy today and tomorrow that are obviously \\nvery important to our economy. \\n That can't be seen in isolation from Belt and Road Initiative because if Belt and \\nRoad Initiative is even somewhat successful, it sets out the broad framework for China to further \\ncompete well and grasp the, as they call it, the commanding heights of those industries, which \\nare going to further be detrimental to our ability to compete in those industries. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Just to add, both, detrimental both to \\nour abilities to compete but also to the abilities of dissenting voices to be able to speak up and be \\nheard. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Well said.  Commissioner Stivers, please. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Thank you.  Thank you all for being here today \\nand for just excellent work you've done on this issue and, in particular, the focus that you've had \\non the noninfrastructure side of the Belt and Road Initiative because I would say 80 to 90 percent \\nof the literature that's written about Belt and Road is about the infrastructure part of it.  \\n And this other part on the high tech, the telecommunications, I think is more of a \\nconcern for the rest of the international community than the infrastructure part of it although \\nthey're both concerned.  Angela Merkel just said, I think yesterday, that data is the raw material \\nof the 21st century, and the question of who owns the data will decide in the end whether \\ndemocracy, a participatory social model, and economic prosperity can be combined. \\n And, of course, there's major implications if, you know, the fastest growing \\nregion of the world with two-thirds of the world's people and half of the world's GDP is \\ndominated by Huawei as the major telecommunications provider for that region and Baidu as the \\ndominant GPS satellite for that region.  And how do you compete with that?  \\n I mean there's so much incentives provided by the Chinese government through \\nMade in 2025 and a host of other things.  You know I know we compete on infrastructure, the \\nJapanese can, the Koreans can, the World Bank can, the Asian Development Bank can.  They \\nneed more help certainly, but I see a healthy competition on infrastructure if the international \\ncommunity, you know, is up to it. \\n But on the high-tech side, can we compete? And how? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that's an exceptionally important issue that's probably \\nworthy of yet another hearing.  I think it goes certainly on the subsidy--the cash side of this is \\ncertainly important.  But also as a lot of my colleagues in Beijing would comment and have been \\nfor a number of years--standards has been something.  Patent standards, the who sets the rules of \\nthe road.  China has been working diligently for years now, very successfully, in using their \\nmarket power, just their domestic market power, to be able to change that dynamic and force a \\nnumber of companies into accepting standards that they might not otherwise have to do. \\n And that market power is only being expanded now with Belt and Road Initiative \\nin a sense, but that is absolutely playing into, particularly the technology piece, of the \\ncompetitiveness.  And so we're often seeing now concerns about how China is coercing \\ntechnology transfer as part of the ability to have market access in China.  That is only going to \\ngrow with this, this process. \\n\\n5656\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n That is going to absolutely affect how some of our best companies are able to \\ncompete in that market and beyond and will set the stage for how they have to deal with partners \\nelsewhere. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Thank you. \\n I also think that the standards part must be part of the solution, and I think that, \\nyou know, that's done through a number of fora, and, you know, standard setting is done both \\nwith partners and allies, but it's also done through the U.S. leadership position in multilateral \\ninstitutions, and so I think it's important to sustain our leadership in those institutions, and I think \\nit's important to also expose instances when standards are not met, and tell those stories about the \\nconsequences of adopting, you know, lower standards, the consequence of adopting lower \\nquality instead of paying for higher quality up front. \\n And I do think, though, even though I mean I agree entirely about the importance \\nof data, I think some of these standards questions, the data and the infrastructure go hand-in-\\nhand.  The infrastructure building is often a conduit through which standards are accepted and \\nspread, and so I think that we need to, as Nad\\u00e8ge was mentioning earlier, consider this \\nholistically, both the data side and the infrastructure that makes the data possible. \\n I don't think the solution is to, you know, meet China head on with our own \\nsubsidies.  We're not going to out-China China.  And I think that we need to focus on what we're \\ngood at and what our companies are good at, which is providing reliable products, which is \\nupholding standards, many of which exist and need to be enforced. \\n Thank you. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Just very--sorry, Ms. Rolland.  Mr. \\nPhillips, I just wanted you to know that we actually are having a hearing in April where the \\nstandards issue will be being brought up. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Outstanding.  Well done. \\n [Laughter.] \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  What's the date? \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Oh, I don't know if we have a date.  Do \\nwe have a date?  Oh, it's March.  Sorry, it's March.  I was wrong.  It was March 8. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Ms. Rolland. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  No.  I just wanted to just reinforce what has been said.  I fully \\nagree on that.  I want to go a little bit beyond that and think about not just the industrial standards \\nand all the international standards but also in terms of intellectual leadership.  China has been \\noffering tens of thousands of scholarships for students to go study in China--students from Belt \\nand Road countries.  And that's part of one of the five pillars of Belt and Road.  It's about people-\\nto-people exchanges. \\n And in my mind those scholarships are not just for students to come, learn \\nChinese, but it's also, I believe, a way to train the elites of these countries so maybe in the long \\nrun there will be a better understanding between China and those political and military elites in \\nthe region through those people-to-people exchanges and scholarships. \\n So when you think about standards, it's not just about industrial and high-tech \\nstandards. It's also about training future generation of leaders in the region. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  If I can ask one more question.  On the role of \\ncivil society, what we have, you know, one of the big advantages of international development \\nbest practices is that they engage with--it's supposed to at its best engage with the people more so \\nthan the government. There's always a role for both, but you don't see China doing that as much. \\n\\n5757\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n Their deal is with the government.  They're not transparent, and the people are \\noften an afterthought, which has gotten a lot of these projects in trouble.  I think the two, you \\nknow, major openings that have happened in the region, in Sri Lanka and in Burma, have had a \\ndirect correlation to China's development projects in those two countries, and I think that \\ncorrelation is significant. \\n So are Chinese leaders kind of understanding the role of civil society in these \\ncountries more?  Are they becoming more sophisticated in that engagement part of it?  Or do \\nthey just not get that part of it?  Because obviously the success of their projects are going to need \\nto have that engagement from the people who are affected or the different, or civil society in \\nthese countries in order for them to be effective. Are they making changes in the way they're \\naddressing these projects or not so much? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  It's a yes and no.  Yes, in that certainly the people who are \\nwhether it's in the foreign ministry or other agencies of government who are involved with this \\nprocess or the key state-owned enterprises, and they're seeing it on the front end that, yes, they \\nhear the complaints about whether it's Chinese labor for the projects or seeing benefits filter \\ndown to local society and realizing that maybe they need to have at least a perceived lighter \\nhand. \\n But I'd go back to the point that was raised earlier about China just sees this \\nprocess differently than we see it through our eyes coming back to the colonialist aspect of this. \\n They genuinely through their own internal dialogue and rhetoric and belief is that \\nit's-- China's a great country and others are lesser countries, and it doesn't mean that they're bad.  \\nIt's just that they're lesser.  And that China is doing good by this and that others ought to be \\nthankful for that, and therefore they're less concerned about the civil society piece of this than we \\nmight think. \\n And I'm not making that as a value judgment.  It's just they don't quite see it as a \\nheavier burden than others might see it. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  I think that it's a trial and experiment and learning process.  \\nYou know we need to remind ourselves that this is quite new for China.  This is a big \\\"going \\nout\\\" on steroids strategy.  So yes, they've done that before in Africa, and they also came across \\nsome problems there, and I think they have learned from it. \\n The same as their relation with government.  You know, traditionally I think that \\nthe central authorities in China tended, used to privilege their relationship with the actual \\ngovernment without looking or forming bonds with opposition parties or other members of the \\npolitical elites. \\n Over the years I think China has improved this capacity to know better different \\nactors in the countries and not just focus on the government. And similarly I think now being \\naware of that importance of civil society, I think they're also trying to reach out to those, to those \\ngroups in a different way. \\n I think there's, here it's more bottom up approach, probably coming from the \\nSOEs themselves or the firms that are actually operating on the ground and trying to at their level \\nfigure out how to be more engaging with the local people.  And I think they're trying to set up \\nsome good standards of behavior for their workers and trying to maybe employ local workers so \\nthat they can also be engaged in the project itself.  So raising the benefit for the local people as \\nwell.  So, yeah, learning. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Do you think they're doing that? \\n MS. ROLLAND:  I think they're, I think they're trying.  I think they're trying.  I \\n\\n5858\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthink, again, it's not like they're oblivious to what's going on.  I think they know in different \\ncountries what happened, and they learned from it, and then I don't think they're going to repeat \\nthat mistake afterwards. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Let me--we have a couple more questions we \\ncan get out before this panel closes.  And I think it's very important for us to hear from each of \\nyou on, as you know, our responsibility is to report to Congress with recommendations, and so \\nwe've talked about what it means for Beijing or China to be successful. \\n What does the United States do?  What does Congress in particular do in order for \\nus to successfully navigate, counterbalance, or what, the next 30 years?   \\n I'd also like, Mr. Phillips, if we have time, for you to comment on what American \\ncompanies should do because I know that's a particular area of expertise. \\n So why don't we start with Mr. Hillman.  If you could hit it, you know, hit it home \\nand tell us specifically--we have many committees here--what needs to happen here in \\nWashington and beyond? \\n MR. HILLMAN:  Thank you. \\n So I think in many ways the best response to Belt and Road is not a response at \\nall.  It's a more compelling U.S. vision and I think it's been encouraging that there's been support \\nbuilding for the free and open Indo-Pacific concept, but I think more needs to be done to \\noperationalize that, and I think, you know, at the end of the day resources matter more than \\nrhetoric. \\n I think there's a series of things that Congress could do to help operationalize that \\nconcept, which isn't the entirety of Belt and Road. Belt and Road goes other places.  But that \\ndoes seem to be the sort of central opportunity right now.  \\n I think one thing that could be done is, you know, instructing the administration to \\ncome up with principles and standards for quality infrastructure.  That term gets thrown around a \\nlot--quality--and I think there are competing definitions for what it means, not only in terms of \\noutcomes but even more difficult to define the necessary processes that get you to those \\noutcomes. I think that's something that we can develop also with partners and allies. \\n And then again I think funding, you know, fully resourcing and maintaining the \\nU.S. leadership position in multilateral development banks.  For the U.S. commercial agencies \\nthat are involved with this, I think that there's, you know, certainly always merit in considering \\ncould we streamline some of what we do and combine functions?  And I know that's a sort of \\nlonger-standing debate that many, some people have tried, and certainly merit in thinking it \\nthrough. \\n I think at the end of the day the basic functions need to be there, and we need to \\nsupport them.  China has a whole host of tools that a lot of which have been mentioned today \\nthat it uses to advance the Belt and Road.  I think the minimum that we can do is give our \\ncommercial, U.S. commercial agencies what they need to operate. \\n And I think, you know, beyond that, I think the U.S. goal should really be not to \\nthrow federal money at, you know, a Marshall Plan for Asia or something like that, but in setting \\nthese standards and building support for them.  I think we can catalyze more private sector \\ninvestment. \\n There's about, you know, $100 trillion in institutional funds that are looking for \\nreliable long-term returns.  Many of these areas are very risky, and I'm under no illusion that \\nlarge chunks of that treasure chest are going to go to projects in some of the places we're talking \\nabout. \\n\\n5959\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n But I think more can, and I think more can by having the U.S. play a more \\nproactive role in setting standards and managing some risks.  And ultimately that gets toward \\nproviding better alternatives for the recipient countries who are considering these offers.  You \\nknow, on the one hand, something that starts tomorrow.  On the other hand, something that might \\ntake a little while longer, might cost a little more up-front, but will, you know, give you a better \\nreturn in the longer run. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Ms. Rolland. \\n MS. ROLLAND:  Yes.  Thank you.  I think the first step you're doing already, is \\nbringing awareness, you know, to what's going on so that we can see what we can do.  This is not \\na small thing. This is a very important one. \\n The second thing I think is keeping open the possibility of giving alternatives to \\nthese countries.  China is really going out to develop mostly developing countries.  And they \\ndon't really have other alternatives, and so I think the U.S. and its allies--that's the European in \\nme that's speaking.  I think this is something that we have to do together. \\nThe U.S. itself won't, has the capacity, but I think this is really something that we have to do in \\ncooperation with its allies in Europe but also in Asia.  India and Japan have started to provide \\nthose alternatives, and I think there's a lot of things that we can, we in the U.S. can do more and \\nbetter in conjunction with those initiatives, again to provide alternatives for these countries. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n Mr. Phillips. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you. \\n I absolutely agree with, I think, as well, the first piece is what we're doing here \\ntoday, and that is the awareness of this and have our eyes wide open.  And again I can't stress \\nenough that we can't look at any of this in isolation.  Belt and Road Initiative, as ambitious and \\nbroad as it is, is also together with Made in China 2025 and other soft power projection of what \\nChina does and is trying to enhance. \\n I mentioned earlier about some of their ability to deal with civil society, et cetera.  \\nThey're quite good in their United Front Work Department, the Party, and across the world in \\nworking with other political parties, civil organizations, to influence.  That's their job in life.  \\nThat's essentially what we're talking about here.  They'll get better at this and do it.  But this is a \\ndeadly serious program.  So we have to have our eyes wide open.   \\n The second thing, at the risk of raising a seriously dead horse here, the Trans-\\nPacific Partnership-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  --or I forget what it's called now.  Justin Trudeau's new \\nComprehensive, it's the CPTPP. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  That is now apparently going to come to fruition with the other \\n11 countries. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  March 8, I think. \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  March 8.  Exactly.  We advocated quite heavily for this out of \\nBeijing, and here's why.  It's for this very reason.  It wasn't about trade to those of us on the \\nground in Beijing.  It was about the fundamental principle here that we've been talking around \\nthis entire hearing, and that is China's market power and its ability to throw its economic weight \\naround to the potential detriment of the United States. \\n How do we compete against that?  The U.S., as powerful as we are and as strong \\n\\n6060\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nof an economy as we are, we are not the size economy as part of the whole in the world that we \\nwere after World War II.  We're not going to be able to win this by throwing money at it.  We're \\ngoing to need allies, and we're going to need to partner with others. \\n And the whole benefit of TPP from our perspective was it changed that \\nfundamental dynamic that is at the heart of all this, that China believes that you need that market \\nmore than they're worried about losing your investment.  So how do you change that? \\n Well, you create a bigger market that China is the odd person out, and now you've \\ngot 40 percent of the world economy operating at higher standards, a different set of benefits, \\nand suddenly there's an incentive there for China to have to at least moderate some of its \\nbehavior to be able to compete. \\n Now how you get from here to there, that's up to Congress and others to decide \\nhow to do, but that was the only game in town that we saw--the TPP--to be able to at least try to \\nget us from here to there.  So something has to get us from here to there.  And hopefully we'll \\nhave more hearings on that. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  So I think the question about American \\ncompanies, we can hold to an offline conversation because I know Commissioner Stivers has a \\nburning question.  No, go ahead, please.  We have time. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Sure.  Yes, I have a lot of questions.  But since \\nwe're talking about TPP and trade, let's get into that a little bit without getting into the trade, \\nwhether for or against it sort of thing. \\n One of the things, I mean you all mentioned, I think some of you mentioned that \\nthe Belt and Road Initiative was a response to the Asia pivot or the rebalance.  And, you know, \\nChina's leaders were worried about that.  The problem I've always seen from the rebalance is that \\nTPP was the only significant economic component of it.  And China recognizes the value of \\ndevelopment.  Asian countries, they want development probably more than trade.   \\n And the question is we didn't have a strong enough development component, and \\nI think of OPIC, you know, where you have a U.S. agency that can help underwrite loans and \\nbrings money back to the Treasury.  It doesn't cost the U.S. government a thing, but yet it can \\nhelp some of our companies make the investments and compete in the region.   Again, brings \\nback money for the Treasury, but then you have, you know, the new budget eliminates OPIC. \\n Hopefully, I think the administration is coming to understanding the importance \\nof something like that.  But whether it's that, whether it's our traditional foreign assistance that is \\nso much, that is so effective, whether it's humanitarian assistance, whether it's disaster, disaster \\nassistance, health, agriculture, we have an advantage there, and we should be focusing on those \\nthings in Asia. \\n But, you know, I think the development component as a response to what China is \\ndoing is an important thing to think about.  Do you have any thoughts about that? \\n MS. ROLLAND:  I just want to go back to the response to the Asia rebalancing \\npolicy.  It is and it is not.  The idea has been going on for quite awhile in the intellectual elites of \\nBeijing. So--and I think the first mention of this idea, not called Belt and Road but really the \\ncomponents of it, the first one I saw dates back 2001.  So if one thing, the Asia rebalancing \\npolicy maybe has accelerated it, but it didn't--it wasn't born out of this.  That's one, one point. \\n I think it's also why do we see China going out so, so abruptly now?  It's also in \\nreaction I think to what they perceive as a U.S. disengagement in the world, and so they're \\nseizing this opportunity to go out, more forcefully outside. \\n So if the U.S. is more willing to reestablish its credibility as a global leader, that \\n\\n6161\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nwill also have an impact on how China sees its role in the region. \\n For the more economic piece, I'll turn to my colleagues here who know more than \\nI do. \\n MR. HILLMAN:  I agree entirely that withdrawing from TPP was a missed \\nopportunity and one that we continue to pay for.  I think as broad as Belt and Road is, it still is \\nnowhere near a replacement for what that was and could still be. \\n The trade component of Belt and Road is mainly bilateral deals under a large \\nbanner.  So it's not, it's not, it doesn't have that larger market creation, the rule-setting component \\nthat TPP had.  So I do think that that is something worth thinking about. \\n I think your question of foreign assistance and development is also critical.  One \\nof the things that makes Belt and Road so compelling is that it's this positive vision for countries \\nwhose number one priority is development. And so I think until the U.S. provides its own vision-\\n-it need not be framed in opposition to Belt and Road; it needs to be its own positive economic \\nvision--I think that would be the best response. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Closing thought, Mr. Phillips? \\n MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you. \\n On the point for the companies that we see on the ground, it's obviously the \\nmarket in China and Asia as a whole is critical to U.S. companies. Any company worth its salt is \\nthere trying to compete, and some are competing very well.  Many are held back by market \\naccess restrictions and other aspects of a fairly closed system in many sectors that we've talked \\nabout a number of times before.  But the Belt and Road Initiative in this regard is, I think, \\nsymptomatic of the broader issue with China. \\n It's how do you get access to it if you're a U.S. company to compete, and how do \\nyou learn of the opportunities?  How do you partake?  How do you conduct compliance activities \\nto make sure you're doing well by your fiduciary responsibilities, et cetera?  And obviously get a \\nreturn on your investment, make it economically viable. \\n This is something that virtually all of our members in the American Chamber in \\nChina have looked at Belt and Road whether or not--similar to their Chinese counterparts--of is \\nthere something in here for us?  Is there an opportunity?  And they are trying to figure that out. \\n What we've seen thus far is it's been more on what we'd call the software side of \\nthings.  Rather than the major infrastructure players getting the project through the front door, it's \\nsubcontracting for logistics, finance, consulting, et cetera, that kind of piece, and it hasn't been in \\nlarge numbers yet.  It's been very, very small. \\n But then again the overall amount of enacted Belt and Road projects really hasn't \\nbeen all that great as of yet.  So I think it's still to be seen how much U.S. companies are able to \\ncompete in this.  But it, again, comes down to providing a framework for U.S. companies to \\ncompete effectively and have sustainability to compete going forward. \\n And that's where we're going to have come up with a construct in dealing with the \\nentity that is China and the system and the market power that they are utilizing right now to be \\nable to compete against that.  And so we're going to have to have allies.  We're going to have set \\nup a cooperative framework for companies to talk to each other and to be able to know that we're \\npushing back as a government on issues of real concern when there's coerced technology \\ntransfer, lack of protection for IP, patents and standards issues that are problematic, and just \\nsimple reciprocal market access. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  So we will continue this rich conversation \\ntoday, and I'll have to unfortunately bring this panel to a close, and we will convene again in ten \\n\\n6262\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nminutes for going deeper at the next topic, which is the geostrategic and the military drivers. \\n Thank you very much, all three of you.  We could have spent half the day with \\nyou on this.  Very well done.  Thank you. \\n [Whereupon, a short recess was taken.] \\n  \\n\\n6363\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPANEL II INTRODUCTION BY CO-CHAIR DENNIS C. SHEA \\n \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Good morning.  We will reconvene for our second panel.  Our \\nsecond panel today looks at the geostrategic and military drivers and implications of the One \\nBelt One Road Initiative.  Now we have a fantastic panel of experts, unfortunately, one of whom \\nhas that infamous flu bug.  Joel Wuthnow will not be with us today unfortunately so we're left \\nwith two--but two really good ones. \\n We will begin with Ely Ratner.  Dr. Ratner is the Maurice R.

GREENBERG SENIOR FELLOW FOR CHINA STUDIES, COUNCIL ON \\n\\nFOREIGN RELATIONS \\n \\n\\nDR. RATNER:  Mr. Commissioner, thank you so much.   \\n It's a great opportunity to be here today. You should never give think tankers \\nmore time to talk. \\n [Laughter.] \\n DR. RATNER:  Just as a pro tip.  But I'll try to be--I will try to be as close to that \\nas I can and we can come back.  I'm just going to hit the wave tops of my written testimony. \\n Let me just start with the contextual point of the overall trend lines, which I began \\nmy written testimony with, which I think overhangs any discussion of the Belt and Road \\nInitiative, which is four points: \\n Number one, the United States and China are locked in a consequential \\ngeopolitical competition right now that will determine the character of the 21st century; \\n Number two, the United States is losing that competition right now and increasing \\nthe likelihood not just that the U.S.-led liberal order will be undermined, but that a China-led \\ndominated region will emerge; \\n Third, the United States government has failed to approach this competition with \\nanything approximating its seriousness to date, and I say that as a former official; \\n And fourth, despite that and despite current trends, the United States can arrest \\nChina's momentum here and prevent the growth of an illiberal order in Asia if we put our \\nstrategy and our resources and our attention that are deserved to this set of issues. \\n So I wanted to put that on the table first.  I know you've spoken already about the \\neconomic drivers and imperatives of the Belt and Road Initiative.  I do think those are in many \\nways primary, but the military and the geostrategic effects are quite significant and barely below \\nthe surface and definitely worthy of consideration. \\n So, again, thank you for convening this important discussion. \\n I'm going to talk about three things briefly.  Number one, the security benefits, the \\nadvantages that China is deriving from Belt and Road.  Second, the security risks that are going \\nto emerge for China.  And then finally some recommendations for U.S. policy in response. \\n As it relates to the benefits, I think you've already spoken about energy security, \\nwhich the Chinese obviously see not just as an economic issue but as a military issue as well.  \\nThe diversified trade routes for energy imports is I think the most direct and indisputable \\nstrategic benefit for the Chinese from the Belt and Road, allowing them to avoid the Malacca \\nStraits and other choke points where U.S. and partners have significant military capability to \\ndisrupt those flows. \\n The second benefit potentially relates to China counterterrorism efforts insofar as \\nat least from their perspective greater development in some of these impoverished areas may \\nalleviate some of the drivers of terrorism, but it will also allow them to enhance their \\nrelationships with countries in South and Central Asia and the Middle East with which they will \\nwork with and through in their own counterterrorism efforts as it relates to their concerns about \\npotential instability in Western China. \\n Third, overseas military access and presence.  The Chinese government is actively \\nseeking overseas bases to be rotating military forces through, and I would foresee that both the \\nPeople's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police will gain increased access in BRI \\n\\n6565\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nrecipient countries over time. \\n Four, BRI will feed, and you may have spoken about this earlier as well, the \\nemergence of a more illiberal regional security order in which democracy and individual rights \\nwill be largely subservient to economic growth and social stability, and the strategic and military \\nissues around which international or regional intervention will be occurring will be around those \\nilliberal aims rather than the types of multilateral interventions that the United States has favored \\nfor individual rights and freedoms and otherwise, particularly since the end of the Cold War. \\n And then, finally, and I think this is the most important but in some ways the most \\namorphous, BRI will afford China greater coercive capacity over security matters.  And so Belt \\nand Road is important for security, not directly because of the military capabilities that it will \\nafford, but rather because it will create a perception of a China-led economic order in Asia, and \\nthat has all sorts of cascading effects upon the decision-making of other countries, whether to or \\nhow far they want to partner with the United States, and how willing they are to push back \\nagainst certain forms of Chinese coercion or assertiveness if doing so will face both the loss of \\npotential rewards through BRI or economic punishment and coercion. \\n So I think those are the top five security benefits for China. \\n As it relates to risks, clearly terrorism is one that will emerge as China has greater \\ninvestments and more personnel overseas.  The possibility of, again, attacks against Chinese \\nnationals or business interests will increase insofar as the types of projects that they will be \\nfunding will be highly symbolic, highly politically salient, probably politically controversial, and \\nquite soft targets in many ways.  So ripe for a terrorist threat. \\n Second in terms of security risks will be what I would characterize as domestic \\nstability or--sorry--instability in recipient countries.  Insofar as China has had a historical \\nrhetorical position anyhow of not interfering in the domestic politics of other countries, if they \\nhave major $100 million investments, and if Xi Jinping's legitimacy and reputation is on the line, \\nthat's going to change very quickly. \\n And so the domestic political stability and social stability of the--in BRI recipient \\ncountries will become a first order priority for the Chinese, and they will start bearing the \\nsecurity costs of that in terms of both assisting BRI recipient countries in securing their domestic \\npopulations as well as I would suspect over time intervening directly themselves. \\n And then, finally, as it relates to the geostrategic issues and the risks for China, \\nBeijing will despite its best efforts for sure be stepping into regional rivalries that it would like to \\navoid, and it will be doing so in two ways. \\n Number one--and we're already seeing this in the Pakistan-India context--China's \\nprojects will be weighing in on regional rivalries, whether it's again between Pakistan and India \\nor between Iran and Saudi Arabia, that will be very difficult for Beijing not to feel like it's taking \\na side, and again that will draw it into these picking sides in a way it hasn't wanted to in the past. \\n And then, finally, of course, if you look at the map, BRI almost immediately starts \\nentering areas which both Moscow and New Delhi consider parts of their sphere of influence.  \\nSo perhaps Russia is slower than India, but these countries will for sure be seeing greater \\nconcerns in terms of that, that front. \\n Let me just take a couple more minutes then if I do have just a little bit of extra \\ntime to think about recommendations for U.S. policy and happy to come back to any of these. \\n The first point I would make--not a specific recommendation--would just be I \\nwould argue the United States does not need a counter-Belt and Road strategy.  The United \\nStates needs a comprehensive and competitive China strategy.  And so I don't think we should \\n\\n6666\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthink about differentiating the problems and the challenges and opportunities that are associated \\nwith BRI somehow cabined from a whole set of issues associated with China's emerging \\ninfluence.  So I would think about it comprehensively.  \\n But the five areas that I highlighted--and why don't I save the details on this for \\nthe question and answer--the first absolute major point, and this is based upon research that I \\nhave done over the last several years, would be that to the extent that China is growing its force \\nprojection capabilities and its footprint globally, it still remains that the most important theater in \\nterms of the United States' ability to deter and contain that threat is in East Asia. \\n So that if you're worried about Chinese naval bases in Pakistan, the way you deal \\nwith that problem is by staying competitive in East Asia.  Absolutely first and foremost.  And the \\nTrump administration's national defense strategy made that point in terms of the fact that we \\nhave some catching up to do there, and I would just add that the South China Sea is central to \\nthat--an area where our strategic position is slipping--and again if you're thinking about China's \\nability to project political and military power beyond its shores, its immediate periphery is the \\nabsolute priority where we should be focused right now. \\n Second, the United States should rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership or its latest \\nrendition.  Without an alternative put forward by the United States, that perception of China-led \\neconomic order will persist, and there won't be all the military hardware in the world to shape the \\ndecision-making of our partner countries if they see China as their economic future.  So the \\nUnited States needs to lead on trade and economics. \\n Third, I believe the Trump administration or their successor should think seriously \\nabout what I would characterize as a burden-shifting strategy.  We talk about burden-sharing \\nwith countries like China.  I think more actively we should be thinking about burden-shifting.  In \\nareas where the United States is overextended, where we're bearing a disproportionate level of \\ncosts and where China has emerging security interests, we should think about unilaterally \\ndrawing down and forcing them to fill that void whether that's a consensual agreement or not. \\n Last two points, very quickly.  The United States needs to invest much more in \\nrebuilding its information operations and broadcasting.  The Broadcasting Board of Governors \\nhas done a good job of this as it relates to the Russia problem.  But on the China front, and \\nparticularly as it relates to Belt and Road, which I'm sure you heard this morning, there's a lot \\nmore smoke than fire, a lot more about a brand, a lot more about a perception than an economic \\nreality.  \\n The degree to which the United States government can contribute to a separating \\nfact from fiction about what Belt and Road actually is and informing the broader public in some \\nof these countries, all the better. \\n And then the last thing I would add, which may have been raised this morning, is \\nthat the United States in concert with allies and partners should work toward developing \\ncapacity-building for recipient countries to be able to assess themselves the viability of some of \\nthese projects so they don't get stuck in some of these committed debt traps or otherwise that \\nthey may have known better about before. \\n So let me stop there and look forward to your questions.  Thank you so much. \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n6767\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF ELY RATNER \\nMAURICE R.

Greenberg Senior Fellow for China Studies \\nCouncil on Foreign Relations \\n\\nBefore the \\n\\nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\\n2nd Session, 115th Congress \\n\\nHearing on China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative\\n\\nContext \\nAny discussion of Chinese foreign policy and U.S.-China relations should begin with a baseline description \\nof the overall context and dominant trends. I would offer four topline observations. \\n\\nFirst, the United States and China are now locked in a geopolitical competition, primarily still in Asia. How \\nthis competition evolves will determine the rules, norms, and institutions that govern international relations \\nin the coming decades, as well as levels of peace and prosperity for the United States.  \\n\\nSecond, the United States is losing this competition in ways that increase the likelihood not just of the \\ncrumbling of the U.S.-led order in Asia, but also the rise of a China-dominated region. If such a future in fact \\ncomes to be, the region will be less free, less open, and less inclusive than it is today. Many of America\\u2019s \\nforeign policy achievements over the last 75 years will be lost, and it will take generations (at least) to revive \\ncentral elements of today\\u2019s liberal international order.  \\n\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\nThird, the U.S. government has failed to approach this competition with anything approximating its \\nimportance for the country\\u2019s future. Washington remains distracted and unserious about the China \\nchallenge. The Trump administration sounded some of the right notes in its first National Security Strategy, \\nbut on balance its foreign and domestic policies do not reflect a government focused on projecting or \\nsustaining power and leadership in Asia. \\n\\nFourth, despite current trends, the United States can arrest China\\u2019s momentum and prevent the growth of \\nan illiberal order in Asia. The foundations of American power remain strong, while China\\u2019s weaknesses are \\nmounting by the day. There is nothing inexorable about either China\\u2019s rise or American decline. But neither \\nwill these trends reverse themselves without better policy and strategy in Washington.    \\n\\nThis is the context in which we should consider the military and geostrategic considerations of China\\u2019s Belt \\nand Road Initiative (BRI). The United States does not need a counter-BRI strategy; instead, it needs a \\ncomprehensive China strategy to manage the challenges of which BRI is both a cause and symptom.  \\n\\nDrivers and Benefits for China \\nMilitary and geostrategic factors are largely secondary to the economic imperatives of the Belt and Road \\nInitiative.1 The strategy primarily serves China\\u2019s efforts to transform and grow its economy amidst the \\nhangover and slowdown of its exhausted manufacturing and investment-led model at home. Beijing hopes \\nto find big projects and new markets for Chinese firms throughout the various belts and roads. \\n\\nHowever, the strategic dimensions of BRI are barely below the surface. The initiative carries strategic \\nsignificance in part because of what it says about Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping\\u2019s \\nambitions for China\\u2019s role in the world. Xi has quite explicitly retired China\\u2019s moderate, cautious foreign \\npolicy and is instead pursuing greater power and leadership on the global stage.2 In that sense, Belt and \\nRoad bears on military and security affairs because it demonstrates Xi\\u2019s willingness and desire to pursue big, \\nbold ideas that put China at the center of international politics in ways it has strongly resisted in recent \\ndecades. There is no reason to believe he will cabin these efforts to economic initiatives as China\\u2019s military \\nbecomes increasingly capable of projecting power overseas. \\n\\nMoreover, although strategic factors have not been primary motivators, it is still the case that the size, scope, \\nand geography of the initiative are likely to have significant military and geopolitical effects. It will do so \\nboth directly and indirectly, and provide both advantages and risks for Beijing. The possible upshots for \\nChina include the following areas. \\n\\nEnergy security: Diversified trade routes for energy imports are arguably the most direct and indisputable \\nstrategic benefit to China from Belt and Road.3  Beijing is seeking to build roads, ports, and pipelines that \\n\\n1 Nad\\u00e8ge Rolland, China\\u2019s Eurasian Century?

As a result, BRI will likely include pipelines through Russia and Central Asia, as well as deep water \\nports in South and Southeast Asia.  \\n\\nCounterterrorism: Lack of access and transparency continue to obscure the scope of China\\u2019s terrorism \\nproblem in Xinjiang and surrounding provinces. Nonetheless, there have been violent incidents, which are \\nlikely to continue, if not increase, as a result of multiple trends: foreign fighters returning from Syria and \\nIraq; the potential for greater extremist activity in Afghanistan and Central Asia if the United States \\nwithdraws; and growing domestic discontent in western China due to the government\\u2019s enhanced \\noppression of Uighur Muslims.4 Chinese officials argue that economic development is an important part of \\nany counterterrorism program. In this telling, extremism in Xinjiang and neighboring countries will abate to \\nthe extent that Belt and Road brings jobs, education, and higher standards of living. \\n\\nOverseas military access and presence: China\\u2019s government is actively searching for overseas bases to station \\nand rotate military forces, and the People\\u2019s Liberation Army and People\\u2019s Armed Police will gain increased \\naccess in BRI countries.5 This will occur in a variety of ways. Chinese forces will be deployed to narrowly \\nprotect high-priority projects. Host countries may also request security assistance to defend against \\ndomestic instability that could imperil vital infrastructure. Finally, in some instances, China is likely to \\nacquire or control major transportation facilities, including ports and airports, in exchange for Chinese \\ninvestment and debt forgiveness. This has already transpired in Sri Lanka and may again soon in Myanmar.6 \\nThe PLA currently lacks the ability to sustain large numbers of troops far from mainland China. This will \\nchange over time with improvements in training, doctrine, and more access to overseas facilities. With naval \\naccess in the Indian Ocean, the PLA will eventually be able to protect and disrupt vital shipping lanes, while \\nalso basing forward submarines and anti-submarine warfare capabilities that could pose a security challenge \\nto regional countries, particularly India. \\n\\nIlliberal regional security order: If Belt and Road proceeds as China envisions, it is likely that an illiberal \\nregional order will develop in which democracy and individual rights are largely subservient to economic \\ngrowth and social stability. China has been hostile to sovereignty violations under the precepts of the liberal \\ninternational order, and is already building an alternative set of rules, norms, and institutions that seek to \\ncircumscribe the ability of the international community to protect and defend individual rights against the \\nwishes of their governments. The point here is not that external intervention will not occur\\u2014China has \\nmostly, despite its rhetoric, already abandoned its strict policy of non-interference.7 What it does mean is \\n\\n4 Robbie Gramer, \\u201cThe Islamic State Pledged to Attack China Next.

It is also likely \\nthat the Eurasian continent overall will become less free and more authoritarian, which is already occurring \\nin places where China has dominant influence.  \\n\\nGreater coercive capacity over security matters: Belt and Road is arguably most important for security issues \\nbecause it creates the perception of a China-led economic order in Asia. As Christopher Johnson at CSIS \\nsuccinctly put it, BRI helps \\u201cto reinforce the emerging global narrative that China is moving to the center of \\nglobal economic activity, strength, and influence.\\u201d8 This has direct implications for military issues insofar as \\ncountries will be increasingly unwilling to partner with the United States or push back on Chinese \\nassertiveness if they believe it will result in tangible and costly forms of retribution. China is already using \\neconomic carrots and sticks to coerce U.S. allies and partners to reduce security cooperation with the United \\nStates.9 Prominent recent examples include South Korea (over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense \\nmissile defense system) and the Philippines (over disputes in the South China Sea). Countries as far as \\nGreece are carrying Beijing\\u2019s water on political matters in the European Union to reap what they expect to \\nbe the spoils of Belt and Road. Beijing\\u2019s neutering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \\nover the South China Sea is exemplary of how states and collections of states are likely to defy their national \\nsecurity interests to bend to China\\u2019s demands for economic purposes.  \\n\\nSecurity Risks for China \\nChina will face significant, and in many ways new, security challenges as a result of Belt and Road. These \\ninclude terrorism, domestic instability in partner countries, and heightened regional rivalry. China\\u2019s \\ngovernment, even if cognizant of these risks, is not curbing its ambitions and lofty rhetoric for Belt and \\nRoad for at least three reasons. First, there is a deeply-held belief in the stabilizing effects of development, \\nsuch that over time a successful BRI will resolve, or at least temper, the most acute security challenges. \\nSecond, Belt and Road is seen in Beijing as part of an overall effort to revive and transform China\\u2019s \\nstruggling economy, which is tied to regime legitimacy and social stability. Third, and perhaps most \\nimportantly, Belt and Road is personally important to Xi Jinping and is now closely interlinked with his \\nlegitimacy and legacy. Chinese bureaucrats have therefore taken on an unquestioning, uncritical drive, \\nregardless of the attendant security risks and political fallout likely to emerge. This is all to say that none of \\nthe risks discussed below are likely to weaken Beijing\\u2019s enthusiasm and determination over Belt and Road in \\nthe coming years.  \\n\\nTerrorism: Belt and Road will likely raise the potential for acts of terrorism against Chinese nationals and \\nbusiness interests, both at home and abroad in BRI-recipient countries. Many of the proposed \\ntransportation and trade routes pass through areas already suffering from terrorism and insurgency. At the \\nsame time, Chinese overseas investments in the developing world have at times fueled resentment when \\naccompanied by corruption, environmental damage, low labor standards, and few economic benefits for \\nlocal populations. The political exigencies of advancing BRI projects will only increase the likelihood of non-\\neconomically viable projects that result in some combination of wasted resources, mounting debt, and \\nabandoned efforts. This could turn and sharpen more extremist venom toward China. Two additional \\nfactors could animate these trends. First, China\\u2019s own extraordinary and deepening oppression of Muslim \\n\\n8 Chris Johnson, \\u201cPresident Xi Jinping\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative,\\u201d Center for Strategic and International Studies, March 2016, p. 2. \\n9 Evan A.

By thrusting its economic future and Xi Jinping\\u2019s legitimacy on BRI\\u2019s success, China will have an \\noutsized stake in supporting friendly regimes and preserving domestic stability in recipient countries. This is \\nfairly evident transitivity: greater investments leading to greater interests leading to enhanced measures to \\ndefend and protect against security threats to those interests. In the first instance, this will result in China \\nproviding resources to BRI countries to secure high-profile projects. Beijing has said it will rely on partner \\ncountries rather than provide security itself. This is fine in theory, but is unlikely to work: instability already \\nreigns throughout these territories exactly because the host government is unable to provide higher levels of \\nsecurity. China will start with arms sales and technical assistance, but likely will find itself inserting \\npersonnel and its own military hardware into recipient countries before too long. That will put China \\nalongside partner countries putting down insurgencies and suppressing dissent. Moreover, if Chinese \\nnationals or businesses fall victim to political violence in recipient countries, Beijing will face considerable \\ndomestic pressure to respond with force. \\n\\nHeightened regional rivalry: China is fond of presenting its foreign policies as \\u201cwin-win\\u201d and to the benefit of \\nall countries. This was relatively easy to do when China had a small footprint and was not inserting itself in \\nregional affairs outside of its immediate periphery. This will change as China builds strategic infrastructure \\nand extends its influence and power into contested areas and rivalrous regions. Already, the China-Pakistan \\nEconomic Corridor, so far the marque element of BRI, has raised hackles in New Delhi by pursuing \\ninvestments in territory claimed by both India and Pakistan. Permanent or rotational PLA Navy presence at \\nports in the Indian Ocean will also heighten tensions with India. Likewise, projects in the Middle East will \\ninvariably affect the regional competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran.10 Projects in Eastern Europe will, \\neven if inadvertently, put a thumb on the scales between Western Europe, the European Union, and Russia. \\nIn each instance, China\\u2019s efforts to not pick sides will become untenable, and Beijing will become \\nincreasingly invested in supporting specific parties. Moreover, China\\u2019s influence will envelop areas that \\nIndia and Russia consider within their traditional spheres of influence. This will produce overt competition \\nover third countries when and where interests diverge between Beijing, New Delhi, and Moscow. Military \\nrelations and security assistance are likely to feature as important elements of those contests. \\n\\nRecommendations for U.S. Policy \\nAt least five principles should animate U.S. policy in response to potential strategic implications of Belt and \\nRoad: first, the U.S. security competition with China remains most urgent and intense in East Asia; second, \\neconomics and security are intimately linked and should be considered as essential legs of any policy; third, \\nthe United States needs an affirmative economic agenda in Asia, not just a defensive strategy against the \\nnegative externalities of BRI; fourth, public narratives are as important as the reality on the ground; five, the \\npotential for backlash against China should not create complacency or give the impression that China\\u2019s \\ninfluence is not expanding nonetheless. \\n\\n10 Ilan Goldenberg and Ely Ratner, \\u201cChina\\u2019s Middle East Tightrope,\\u201d Foreign Policy, April 20, 2015, \\nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/20/china-middle-east-saudi-arabia-iran-oil-nuclear-deal/. \\n\\n73Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nPrevent China from controlling the South China Sea: The analysis above suggests that Belt and Road will draw \\nand allow for greater Chinese military presence overseas, particularly in South and Central Asia. My own \\nresearch on the implications of greater Chinese force projection capabilities arrived at the following \\n(perhaps non-intuitive) conclusion: in response to China\\u2019s growing force projection capabilities, the highest \\nstrategic priority for the United States should be ensuring that it remains competitive in East Asia and does \\nnot cede maritime zones within the \\u201cFirst Island Chain\\u201d in ways that give China free range to protect forces \\nfrom deep within the South China Sea.11 Belt and Road may solve China\\u2019s \\u201cMalacca Dilemma,\\u201d but it will \\nnot in and of itself alleviate America\\u2019s ability to hold the Chinese military at risk along its littoral. I have \\npresented my recommendations elsewhere for a comprehensive strategy for the South China Sea, and will \\nonly say here that current U.S. policy and inattentiveness is abetting ultimate Chinese control of the South \\nChina Sea.12 If brought to conclusion, this will significantly enhance the coercive value of any overseas \\nChinese military presence in the Indian Ocean region. Bottom line: if the United States wants to reduce the \\npotential threat of overseas PLA deployments as a result of BRI, it should focus first and foremost on East \\nAsia, specifically the South China Sea. \\n\\nRejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership: U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) constitutes the \\nTrump administration\\u2019s biggest strategic mistake in Asia to date. Heightened concerns over America\\u2019s \\ncommitment to the region and greater perceived likelihood of a China-led economic order have quickly \\ncascaded into the security realm.13 As a leading indicator in the South China Sea, regional countries have all \\nbut folded their hands in the absence of an alternative pole of power and influence from the United States. \\nWhere similar dynamics are present, this trend will likely play out repeatedly if and when BRI investments \\nbegin to flow. Although parts of Belt and Road will necessarily fall outside the scope of U.S. efforts to set \\nhigh-standard trade and investment rules, knitting together TPP with the Transatlantic Trade and \\nInvestment Partnership (T-TIP) with Europe would have bracketed both sides of BRI, reducing China\\u2019s \\ncoercive boon, resisting the spread of illiberalism, and creating political space for continued security \\ncooperation with the United States. The Trump administration\\u2019s strategy of pursuing a \\u201cfree and open Indo-\\nPacific region\\u201d is the right instinct, but will fail without an economic component on par with the scale and \\nscope of TPP. The Trump administration\\u2019s approach to revising or even withdrawing from the Korea-U.S. \\nFree Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement will also shape the willingness of \\nU.S. partners to engage in trade negotiations with the United States. The military consequences of BRI will \\nbe substantially larger without U.S. economic leadership in Asia and globally. \\n\\nEngage in active \\u201cburden-shifting\\u201d: BRI will increase China\\u2019s interests in the stability and governance of areas \\nwhere the United States is currently spending considerable resources. Afghanistan is the most obvious \\nexample, followed by Pakistan and parts of the Middle East. U.S. policymakers should map areas where \\nChina\\u2019s interests are rising and, concurrently, the United States is overextended or bearing disproportionate \\ncosts.

In fact, much of what China cites as Belt and Road projects either \\npredate the initiative or would have happened anyway in the natural course of China\\u2019s economic assistance \\nand activity.14 Chinese officials have also talked about incorporating Latin America and the Arctic into Belt \\nand Road, which would effectively make it simply a moniker for Chinese foreign policy, not a specific set of \\ninitiatives. This calls for more U.S. media and information platforms that can provide a degree of level \\nsetting about the facts and fictions of BRI, as well as the degree of U.S. and other country investment and \\nassistance. Citizens in Southeast Asia, for instance, might be surprised to hear that U.S. and Japanese \\nforeign direct investment in their region is considerably larger than Chinese. Both U.S. officials and U.S.-\\nsupported media can help to paint a more realistic and accurate picture of BRI. High-level statements \\nvoicing concerns about BRI from Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson have been important. The Trump \\nadministration\\u2019s sometimes-heard rhetorical formula is a good one: \\u201cIn a globalized world, there are many \\nbelts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of dictating 'one belt, one road.'\\u201d15 \\nU.S. officials should also consider talking about the \\u201cBelt and Road Strategy,\\u201d rather than using Beijing\\u2019s \\nmore innocuous \\u201cBelt and Road Initiative.\\u201d It would be even more effective to coordinate these messages \\nwith partners, particularly members of the newly-revived Quad (Australia, India, and Japan). The Trump \\nadministration has also begun to articulate an alternative vision of a \\u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific\\u201d that \\nprotects the independence and sovereignty of regional countries.16 U.S. foreign policy will have to do more \\nto reflect this commitment to a more liberal order. In addition, current efforts to enhance U.S. broadcasting \\nand information operations, largely in response to Russian disinformation campaigns, should also focus on \\ndeveloping more capable China-related and Chinese-language platforms to report on BRI activities in \\nrelevant countries.  \\n\\nCapacity-building for recipient countries: It bears underscoring that Belt and Road is not an inherently bad \\nthing, despite the discussion herein of potential security challenges.

That being said, negative externalities will develop if recipient countries are subject to corruption \\nand coercion, or caught in debt traps that China exploits for political and strategic ends. At the low end of \\nthe spectrum, the United States should consider teaming up with like-minded countries (including Australia, \\nJapan, and Singapore) to provide technical assistance to help recipient countries evaluate proposed major \\ninfrastructure projects.

Chinese \\nsources suggest that Beijing is using BRI investments as a means of stabilizing border regions, \\nsecuring energy supply routes, and cultivating stronger diplomatic and economic influence with \\npartner nations. However, those goals could be constrained by challenges ranging from the \\nphysical risks of operating in remote and unstable areas to the possibility of unilateral and \\ncoordinated opposition from other major powers. These are in addition to the inherent economic \\nchallenges associated with infrastructure development (such as the ability of developing and \\npoorly governed states to repay debts).  \\n\\nAware of the risks, Beijing is marshalling all forms of national power to create a safer and more \\nstrategically advantageous context for the BRI. The People\\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is \\nimproving its ability to carry out non-traditional security operations such as non-combatant \\nevacuations and disaster relief missions at longer range and for longer periods. China is also \\ndeveloping other options, including host nation support, private security firms, and law \\nenforcement initiatives, to secure BRI personnel and assets. At the strategic level, Beijing is \\nusing high-level engagements, public diplomacy, and economic inducements to reduce the \\npotential for the BRI to aggravate competition with other major powers. \\n\\nChina\\u2019s success will depend in part on the reactions of other countries. From a U.S. perspective, \\nthe Trump administration will have to weigh competing factors as it designs a response: overt \\nconfrontation with Beijing may impose a cost on U.S. firms hoping to take advantage of new \\nopportunities and harm U.S.-China relations, while accommodation could fuel Chinese \\nambitions, jeopardize U.S. interests in prudent lending and market access, and alienate U.S. \\npartners such as Japan and India that have expressed serious concerns about China\\u2019s activities.  \\nThe Department of Defense will also have to consider tradeoffs as it decides whether, and how, \\nto collaborate with the PLA in ways that enhance security along BRI routes. At a minimum, the \\n\\n1 The views expressed in this testimony are those of the author and are not an official policy or position of the \\nNational Defense University, the Department of Defense or the U.S. Government.

Mitigating threats across China\\u2019s restive western periphery is a\\nperennial challenge for Beijing. Key problems include Tibetan and Uighur separatist\\nmovements and their cross-border advocates, narcotics trafficking, infiltration of Islamic\\nextremists into western China via Central Asia, and even concerns about foreign-\\nsponsored \\u201ccolor revolutions\\u201d in border areas.8 Fostering infrastructure development and\\nregional economic connectivity, in the view of Chinese analysts, can help address the\\nroots of instability by lifting neighboring populations out of poverty, bolstering (often\\nauthoritarian and China-friendly) regimes, and tying Xinjiang more closely into the\\nregional economy. A related benefit, though not explicitly argued in Chinese sources, is\\nthat a safer western border region implies fewer strategic distractions and more resources\\navailable for China to expand its influence across maritime Asia.9\\n\\n\\u2022 More Secure Energy Supply and Transport Routes. Another persistent dilemma has been\\ndiversifying China\\u2019s energy supplies, which remain heavily dependent on maritime\\ntransport routes through the Strait of Malacca and other chokepoints.10 Dubbed the\\n\\u201cMalacca Dilemma\\u201d during the Hu Jintao era, the concern is that China\\u2019s oil imports\\ncould be subject to interdiction by foreign navies during a crisis. BRI projects such as an\\noil pipeline linking Pakistan\\u2019s Gwadar Port with Xinjiang and a second Sino-Russian oil\\npipeline (which came online in January 201811) could help reduce, but not eliminate,\\nChina\\u2019s overreliance on vulnerable sea lanes. The BRI\\u2019s maritime component, known as\\nthe Maritime Silk Road, could also help secure China\\u2019s continuing maritime shipments\\nthrough additional port development, including the opening of new PLA navy overseas\\nlogistics bases.12\\n\\n\\u2022 Stronger Chinese Economic and Diplomatic Influence.

For instance, \\ndevelopment of China-Kazakhstan freight and passenger lines since 2013 support the \\nelevation of bilateral relations into a \\u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership,\\u201d which also \\nincludes regular high-level diplomacy, counter-terrorism cooperation, and expansion in \\nbilateral trade.14  \\n\\nWhile articulating clearly defined, and ambitious, strategic objectives, Chinese assessments \\ngenerally avoid more sweeping proclamations about Beijing\\u2019s willingness or ability to create an \\nuncontested, Mackinder-esque sphere of influence in Eurasia. There are several reasons why \\nChinese self-assessed aims may remain limited, rather than expansive. BRI projects are funded \\nprimarily by loans that are meant to eventually be repaid. However, China is investing in \\ncountries that, in many cases, pose significant credit risk: a 2017 Moody\\u2019s analysis, for instance, \\nfound that 54% of BRI investments have gone to countries with poor (i.e. Ba1 or lower) \\ninvestment ratings.15 Christopher Johnson also suggests that the underlying political motives \\ndriving the BRI, including the need to buttress Xi Jinping\\u2019s political legacy, mean that the Party \\nleadership may \\u201cstay the course\\u201d on high-profile but financially unsound projects, resulting in a \\nbleaker long-run economic outlook.16 \\n\\nFrom a security perspective, Chinese analysts are also conscientious of the potential pitfalls. \\nRather than inflating the prospects for strategic gains, Chinese sources tend to focus more on the \\noperational and strategic-level vulnerabilities that Beijing will have to address in order to \\nsuccessfully implement BRI projects. Often debating amongst themselves, authors offer a variety \\nof proposals for how to mitigate those risks using both military and civilian means.   \\n\\nOperational Risks and Mitigation Strategies \\n\\nEven before the BRI was launched in late 2013, China had experienced the dangers involved in \\nconducting business operations in remote and unstable regions. Major incidents, such as 2006 \\nanti-China riots in Zambia and the 2011 Libyan civil war, which required the PLA to conduct an \\nimprovised evacuation of around 35,000 Chinese oil workers, grabbed domestic headlines and \\nplaced an impetus on Beijing to consider how Chinese personnel and assets could be protected.17 \\nThus Chinese officials have been under no illusions about the physical risks involved in building \\ninfrastructure and transportation networks across conflict prone areas of Central and South Asia, \\nand into the Middle East.

These include the March 2015 \\nevacuation of more than 500 Chinese nationals from Yemen, denoting not only risks to overseas \\nworkers, but also regional instability astride key maritime shipping lanes; the November 2015 \\nkilling of a Chinese citizen by ISIS radicals in Syria; the May 2017 abduction and murder of two \\nChinese citizens in Pakistan\\u2019s Baluchistan province (site of Gwadar Port and other key BRI \\nprojects);19 and a December 2017 Chinese embassy warning that terrorist attacks in Pakistan \\nmay be imminent.   \\n\\nChinese analysts anticipate that these types of problems will expand as BRI projects enter their \\nconstruction and operational phases. Key challenges include inter- and intrastate sectarian \\nviolence, which could destabilize host nations and place workers in danger; hostage-taking for \\nransom; terrorist attacks carried out by groups such as ISIS, Pakistani militants, or the Turkestan \\nIndependence Party (formerly known as the East Turkestan Independence Movement); and \\nmajor natural disasters such as earthquakes and mudslides, which may be increasing due to \\nclimate change effects.20 These problems are exacerbated by China\\u2019s limited capacity to address \\nthem. Chinese sources identify problems such as insufficient strategic air and sea lift (needed to \\ncarry out non-combatant evacuations), inadequate private personnel security services, and weak \\npolitical risk analysis capabilities.21 \\n\\nThese assessments have prompted consideration of the ways in which China needs to be \\nprepared to secure its overseas BRI interests. Analysts discuss the tradeoffs of different types of \\napproaches, which include the following:  \\n\\n\\u2022 Stronger Expeditionary Capabilities. One remedy would be expanding expeditionary\\nPLA capabilities, such as more long-range naval deployments (and overseas logistics\\nbases), additional strategic air lift, and more rapidly deployable ground forces.22 Such\\nassets would be helpful in defending critical sea lanes, as well as in conducting non-\\ncombatant evacuation, disaster relief, and counter-terrorism operations.

Another approach is relying more extensively on host nation law\\nenforcement, intelligence, and military support. The most prominent example is a 12,000-\\nstrong force drawn from the Pakistani army that has protected Chinese workers in\\nGwadar and other sites along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor since 2015.24 PLA\\ninterviewees also describe the possibility of working with the Taliban, who they\\ncharacterized as a \\u201cfriendly\\u201d organization, to protect Chinese copper mines in northeast\\nAfghanistan that have been dormant for years because of security concerns.25 Benefits of\\nthis approach could include cost effectiveness, delegation of risks to non-Chinese\\nnationals, and reliance on forces with intimate knowledge of local languages, customs,\\nand terrain. Key challenges, however, would include limited host nation capacity to\\nhandle major emergencies, reliability, and opposition of foreign publics to units being\\nallocated to protect Chinese workers and assets.\\n\\n\\u2022 Private Security Services. A third approach is increasing reliance on foreign or Chinese\\npersonnel security companies, in addition to insurance and risk assessment services.\\nSome Chinese firms may contract with more expensive but experienced foreign security\\nproviders such as Academi (formerly known as Blackwater), while other may hire\\ncheaper domestic contractors.

A final option is to strengthen bilateral or multilateral security\\npartnerships to collectively address risks. Examples include combined training with\\nforeign partners in non-traditional security areas such as counter-piracy, counter-\\nterrorism, and disaster relief;28 maritime security cooperation, such as joint China-\\nASEAN patrols in the Mekong River basin; and intelligence sharing and law enforcement\\ncooperation, including a counter-terrorism mechanism established in 2016 between\\nChina, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.29 These activities provide several\\nadvantages, such as cost distribution, capacity building, and generating mutual trust and\\nregional awareness, but are generally not oriented towards crisis response and remain\\ncontingent on the commitment of resources from both China and partner governments.\\n\\nThe key source of debate between Chinese analysts is how much emphasis to place on building \\nthe PLA, whose Party-defined responsibilities include protection of China\\u2019s overseas interests, \\ninto a more global expeditionary force, versus outsourcing security to different arrangements \\n(host nation support, private security, or international cooperation).30 Although the mix of \\nstrategies remains in flux, extrapolating from current trends suggests that Beijing will rely on a \\nmulti-layered patchwork of different approaches, varying across regions and focused on different \\ntypes of threats, to reduce operational challenges facing the BRI.  \\n\\nStrategic Risks and Mitigation Strategies \\n\\nAt the strategic level, the BRI is not unfolding in a geopolitical vacuum: several other major \\npowers have concerns about how China\\u2019s activities will affect their interests.

One method is developing partnerships with foreign\\ncompanies. One Chinese report, for instance, argued that the BRI will provide U.S. firms\\nwith \\u201cgreat business opportunities in all sectors,\\u201d citing cooperation between General\\nElectric and the China National Machinery Industry Corporation in building Kenya\\u2019s\\nwind power infrastructure as a successful model (albeit not a BRI project per se).41 The\\npremise is that pressure from the business community will translate into political\\nsupport. Whether this approach will succeed in the U.S. context is unclear.

China has also leveraged bilateral relationships to\\nencourage support for the BRI. For example, a November 2017 meeting between Xi and\\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in which the two leaders agreed to make a \\u201cfresh\\nstart\\u201d in Sino-Japanese relations, led in part to Tokyo offering financial incentives for\\nJapanese firms to build joint ventures with Chinese companies in areas related to\\ninfrastructure development (though perhaps intended more as a substitute than a\\ncomplement to the BRI framework).43 China has also solicited U.S. support for the BRI\\nin high-level meetings, though with less tangible results.44 Coercive diplomacy is also an\\noption. Some Indian observers, for instance, contend that China escalated tensions in the\\nDoklam border region during mid-2017 in order to signal dissatisfaction with Prime\\nMinister Narendra Modi\\u2019s absence from the Belt and Road Forum, and to push India into\\na more positive approach toward BRI.45\\n\\n\\u2022 Shaping international public opinion. A third method is working through media, public\\ndiplomacy, and Track II channels to reduce suspicions about the BRI in major countries\\nand explore avenues of cooperation. Messages delivered by PLA interlocutors in recent\\ndiscussions, for instance, include casting U.S. officials\\u2019 criticisms of the BRI, such as\\nthose offered by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in October 2017,46 as unfair, affirming\\nthat China\\u2019s ultimate ambition is not to \\u201creplace the U.S. as world hegemon,\\u201d and\\nframing the BRI as a \\u201cconstructive means\\u201d for both countries to improve relations and\\ncontribute to global public goods provision.47\\n\\nLargely absent from Chinese assessments is the acknowledgement that China\\u2019s own practices \\nmay be contributing to regional demand for alternative infrastructure funding. Secretary \\nTillerson argued that the nature of Chinese financing is burdening partners with \\u201cenormous \\nlevels of debt,\\u201d and resulting in projects that rely on \\u201cforeign workers,\\u201d rather than creating local \\njobs.48 In Djibouti, for instance, three China-backed projects have led the debt-to-GDP ratio to \\nballoon from 50% in 2014 to 85% in 2016, with the International Monetary Fund warning that \\nthe country remains at high risk of debt distress.49 This has prompted concerns about whether \\n\\n43 \\u201cJapan to Help Finance China\\u2019s Belt and Road Projects: Nikkei,\\u201d Reuters, December 5, 2017, \\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-china-beltandroad/japan-to-help-finance-chinas-belt-and-road-projects-\\nnikkei-idUSKBN1E003M.  \\n44 See, e.g., \\u201cU.S. President Donald Trump Meets With Yang Jiechi,\\u201d PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, June 23, \\n2017, http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1473199.shtml.  \\n45 Sushil Aaron, \\u201cIs China Punishing India For Its Belt and Road Stance While Testing Modi and Trump?\\u201d \\nHindustan Times, July 4, 2017, http://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/is-china-punishing-india-for-its-belt-and-\\nroad-stance-while-testing-modi-and-trump/story-1NIB0lcGtgMy4UVO5pDO1M.html.  \\n46 See Rex W.

One approach is \\nusing public diplomacy to counter narratives about China acting as a \\u201cneocolonial power,\\u201d51 but \\nthis message will not resonate if projects fail to create local jobs, worsen local corruption \\nproblems, or create environmental problems.52 Another choice would be debt forgiveness, but \\nthis would strain government coffers and underscore the poor decision-making that contributed \\nto non-performing BRI loans. China may also convert unpaid debt to equity shares in \\ninfrastructure projects, as in Sri Lanka\\u2019s December 2017 decision to grant China a 99-year lease \\nof the Hambantota port to repay part of its $8 Billion debt. However, this could raise local \\nconcerns to even higher levels as critical infrastructure is ceded to a foreign power.53 Thus, states \\nmay seek alternative financing\\u2014or forego projects altogether.54 \\n\\nConclusion and Policy Implications \\n\\nIn sum, the strategic aims driving the BRI\\u2014creating a safer neighborhood, securing energy \\nsupplies, and cultivating influence\\u2014are ambitious, though somewhat attenuated by perceived \\nrisks and challenges. Not only are BRI projects subject to the physical risks inherent in large-\\nscale infrastructure development across the Eurasian hinterland, which are exacerbated by \\nChina\\u2019s limited ability to address them, but the whole enterprise is also vulnerable to unilateral \\nor collective responses by China\\u2019s major competitors. Souring relations between China and \\npartner nations, due to the norms, premises, and stringent terms attached to BRI locations and \\nfinancing, may impose further limits on Beijing\\u2019s ability to convert economic cooperation into \\ngeopolitical gains.  \\n\\nChina\\u2019s success will depend in part on the reactions of other major countries. From a U.S. \\nperspective, policymakers will have to weigh multiple competing factors in designing a coherent \\nresponse. On one hand, overt confrontation with Beijing would be an irritant in U.S.-China \\nrelations and potentially cost U.S. firms the chance to take part in BRI projects (as illustrated by \\na recent agreement between General Electric and China\\u2019s Silk Road Fund in the energy \\ninvestment arena).55 On the other hand, accommodation could imperil U.S. stakes in prudent \\nlending and Eurasian market access, alienate U.S. partners such as Japan and India that have \\nexpressed serious concerns about China\\u2019s activities, and fuel China\\u2019s strategic aims beyond their \\ncurrent levels.

The Trump \\nadministration has offered some implicit critiques of the BRI,56 and suggested the need for \\nalternative infrastructure development approaches. Congress could ask U.S. officials to articulate \\na more detailed strategic approach for protecting U.S. values and interests, including specifying \\nthe resources needed to offer alternatives for the region. In addition, Congress\\u2019s research arms \\ncan sponsor independent analysis of U.S. interests and strategic options (e.g., ways in which the \\nUnited States can partner with Japan, India, and others to promote alternative economic corridors \\nand offer alternative financing).  \\n\\nA narrower question is whether and how the Department of Defense should cooperate with \\nChina in areas related to securing BRI routes. As part of Xi\\u2019s emphasis on improving U.S.-China \\nmilitary relations,57 the PLA has pursued increased operational and training cooperation with the \\nUnited States in areas such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, counter-piracy, and \\ncounter-terrorism.58 From a Chinese perspective, this engagement is not only useful in fostering \\nmutual trust, but may also help create a safer environment for China\\u2019s overseas interests. Some \\nof these activities have already been pursued, including U.S.-China combined counter-piracy \\nexercises in the Gulf of Aden, last held in December 2014, and China\\u2019s participation in the non-\\ntraditional security portions of the U.S.-led multinational RIMPAC exercise. \\n\\nHowever, bilateral military cooperation will need to be pursued in the context of U.S. strategic \\ngoals, policy judgments, and legal constraints. The 2000 National Defense Authorization Act, in \\nparticular, requires the Secretary of Defense to restrict engagements with the PLA in 12 areas \\nwhen contact would create a \\u201cnational security risk due to an inappropriate exposure.\\u201d Counter-\\nterrorism cooperation, for instance, could expose the PLA to advanced warfighting tactics, \\ntechniques, and procedures, even if both countries share an interest in reducing terrorist threats.59 \\nThus caution in responding to Chinese entreaties is warranted, and sensible. At a minimum, the \\ngeographic combatant commands should remain in regular contact with their Chinese \\ncounterparts as PLA units enter their areas of responsibility, so as to better understand Chinese \\ngoals and capabilities, de-conflict activities, and identify areas where both sides may cooperate \\nto achieve shared goals.   \\n\\nU.S. officials should also anticipate that expansion of BRI projects will be accompanied by \\nenhanced Chinese military diplomacy throughout Eurasia.

KLIMAN:  Commissioner Shea, Commissioner Tobin, thank you for the \\n\\nopportunity to testify before this distinguished Commission.   \\nI want to commend you for holding a day-long hearing on different aspects of \\n\\nBRI.  It's a very important issue that cuts across many of the U.S. government's traditional \\nregional offices and functional areas of focus, one that is very hard for the U.S. government to \\nget its head around.   And this type of hearing I think it crucial to informing the U.S. government \\nas it tries to formulate a response, very much hopefully in the larger context of how the U.S. \\ndeals with a rising China. \\n\\nI want to quickly give you some of the wave tops of my written testimony, and I \\nmay stray a little bit beyond seven minutes but I promise I won't go on too long beyond that. \\n\\nFirst, again, context to emphasize.  China seeks to transform the rules-based \\ninternational order, and BRI is one element of that larger approach.  While my testimony is going \\nto focus on BRI, it is important to keep in mind the larger context, which is the need to formulate \\na U.S. response that is nested within a positive American strategy to reinforce the rules, norms, \\nrelationships, and institutions that have underpinned peace, prosperity, and democracy expansion \\nfor more than seven decades. \\n\\nTurning to the drivers beyond BRI.  As you most likely heard during the last \\npanel, they are primarily domestic economic relating to China.  But there are certainly \\ngeostrategic and military considerations.   \\n\\nAbove all, President Xi Jinping's vision of national rejuvenation, a China that is \\npredominant in Asia and a leading power globally in 2049.  And then there are long-standing \\nconcerns about China's energy dependence on potentially vulnerable sea lines of communication \\nand a desire to stand up new China-centric regional and international organizations. \\n\\nGiven BRI's enormous ambitions, even if many projects never deliver or fall \\nthrough, it could still reshape the geostrategic and military landscape of the Indian Ocean Rim \\nand Eurasia in at least six ways. \\n\\nFirst, BRI will increase the demand for China to project military power abroad.  \\nAs Chinese investment and workers flow into far-flung and sometimes unstable regions of the \\nworld, the demand for the PLA to conduct noncombatant evacuations, humanitarian assistance \\nand disaster relief operations, and counterterrorism missions will grow. \\n\\nSo will the demand on the PLA Navy to protect the sea lines of communication.  \\nIn turn, BRI will reinforce the voices within the PLA calling for more investment in power \\nprojection capabilities although the preferences for what form this investment takes will likely \\ndiffer by service. \\n\\nSecond, BRI will enable China to more effectively project power overseas.  The \\ndual-use infrastructure that China constructs through BRI such as ports and airfields can serve as \\nbuilding blocks for a more robust logistics network that enables the PLA to deploy more \\nregularly and at a larger scale into the Indian Ocean and beyond. \\n\\nDjibouti is a case in point where China initially built a commercial port and \\nsubsequently secured agreement from the Djiboutian government for a nearby military facility.  \\n\\n9090\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n Third, BRI will enhance China's diplomatic leverage.  In offering loans to \\ncountries at a level beyond their ability to repay, China has created debt traps that translate into \\nfinancial leverage and permanently unequal diplomatic relationships.  This gives China an \\nopening to parlay dual-use infrastructure constructed by its investment into future military \\nfacilities.  It could also enable China to compel indebted countries to support its larger agenda on \\nissues such as maritime disputes in the South China Sea or in international forums like the \\nUnited Nations. \\n Fourth, BRI will complicate U.S. military operations.  The expansion of the \\nPLA's presence that BRI both accelerates and enables will pose new challenges for how the U.S. \\nmilitary operates.  In peacetime the United States and China will operate in close proximity, not \\nonly in new locations such as the Indian Ocean but also in new ways, such as conducting \\nmissions from bases in Djibouti that are less than ten miles apart. \\n To the extent that BRI paves the way for China to station its submarines in the \\nIndian Ocean, it will increase the undersea threat to U.S. warships operating there. \\n Lastly, China could ultimately seek to deploy destabilizing military capabilities \\nsuch as long-range anti-ship missiles in the bases or military facilities that BRI enables.  This \\nwould create on a small scale the type of anti-access and aerial-denial challenge that currently \\nconfronts the U.S. military in the Western Pacific. \\n Fifth, BRI will bolster China's digital influence.  Digital infrastructure has \\nemerged as a major element of BRI and could pose a unique set of challenges as Chinese \\ncompanies have few qualms about exercising censorship, eroding online privacy or intercepting \\ntrade secrets at the behest of the government in Beijing. \\n China could potentially glean large amounts of data from the digital infrastructure \\nconstructed by BRI.  This data could fuel China's AI industry and also give its companies a \\npotential edge in engaging consumers in markets across Eurasia and the Indian Ocean Rim. \\n Sixth, and finally, BRI will weaken European cohesion on China.  The European \\nUnion's leadership has displayed a cautious approach toward BRI, but states in Central and \\nEastern Europe are eager for Chinese investment, creating frictions.  Chinese investment into \\nCentral and Eastern Europe, though not always large, has already translated into diplomatic \\nleverage. \\n And BRI will likely reduce Europe's capacity to function as a unified actor, \\ncertainly a unified partner in any American response to address not only BRI but also China's \\nlarger mercantilistic trade and investment practices. \\n I now want to turn to some guidelines for how the U.S. responds to BRI, \\nrecognizing that ultimately this must be in the larger context of a positive strategy for sustaining \\na rules-based international order. \\n There are at least six major elements.  The first is avoid a purely confrontational \\napproach.  The United States should learn the lessons of its failed opposition to China's Asian \\nInfrastructure Investment Bank.  Countries need new sources of investment.  They will not reject \\nsomething for nothing. \\n Second, the U.S. must offer a positive vision, one that advances a vision of high-\\nquality physical and digital infrastructure, linking together Africa, Asia, the Middle East and \\nEurope in shared growth and preparation for the economy of the future. \\n This vision should include China.  The U.S. should also leverage its strengths \\nsuch as entrepreneurial models of growth that don't saddle countries with debt and actually build \\ntheir local capacity over the long-term. \\n\\n9191\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n The third element is to place U.S. allies and partners at the center.  This, of \\ncourse, applies to a competitive American approach toward China more generally but certainly \\nwith respect to BRI.   \\n The United States alone cannot effectively respond to BRI given the Initiative's \\nvast geographic scope and the resources that China has dedicated to it.  The United States should \\nseek to incorporate key allies and partners into the planning and execution of strategy toward \\nBRI, recognizing that this may make it more complicated. U.S. allies and partners certainly have \\ndifferent perspectives as I imagine you'll hear in the next panel, but it's essential for the long-\\nterm success of any American approach. \\n The fourth element is that the United States needs to try to shape Chinese \\noverseas basing.  In the context of BRI, the United States and its allies and partners should \\nidentify where a Chinese military presence would be most destabilizing and take action to \\nprevent it or at least mitigate the consequences. \\n It's imperative to communicate to governments considering military access for the \\nPLA, what it might mean for their sovereignty, as well as some of the destructive military \\ncapabilities that Beijing might transfer and that could cause real challenges down the road. \\n The fifth element is to ensure the U.S. military can operate in anti-access and \\narea-denial environments.  Ultimately, a U.S. military designed to fight and prevail in the \\nWestern Pacific will be able to handle the comparatively modest anti-access and area-denial \\ncapabilities that China might deploy to future facilities overseas.  So that is important to keep in \\nmind. \\n And then, finally, six, the United States should focus on digital infrastructure.  \\nU.S. companies have a comparative advantage in the digital domain.  And the potential \\nimplications of the information technology dimension of BRI are the most uncertain and \\npotentially very consequential over the long term. \\n The United States and its allies and partners should consider launching a digital \\ndevelopment bank that would specialize in digital infrastructure across the Indian Ocean Rim \\nand Eurasia. \\n To conclude, now is the time to develop a strategic response to BRI in the larger \\ncontext of sustaining a rules-based international order.  In the absence of a coordinated approach \\nthat brings together the United States, its allies and partners, large parts of the Indian Ocean Rim \\nand Eurasia could ultimately become the core of a new China-centric order. \\n Thank you. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n9292\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF DANIEL KLIMAN \\nSENIOR FELLOW, ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY PROGRAM, CENTER FOR A NEW \\n\\nAMERICAN SECURITY \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n9393\\n\\n\\n\\nJanuary 25, 2018 \\n\\nTestimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \\nCommission \\n\\nThe Geostrategic and Military Drivers and Implications of BRI \\n\\nDaniel Kliman, Senior Fellow, Asia-Pacific Security Program \\nCenter for a New American Security* \\n\\nCommissioner Shea, Commissioner Tobin, thank you for the opportunity to testify before this \\ndistinguished commission on \\u201cThe Geostrategic and Military Drivers and Implications of \\nBRI.\\u201d1 \\n\\nI commend this commission for convening a daylong hearing on different aspects of China\\u2019s \\nBelt and Road Initiative, or BRI. My testimony will focus on the geostrategic and military \\ndrivers and implications of BRI, while also touching on the larger elements of an American \\nstrategy intended to shape BRI to align with international rules and norms, cooperate \\nselectively with China, and compete smartly where required. \\n\\nWhat is BRI, and Why Does It Matter\\n\\nChina is making a trillion-dollar play to shape the economic and geopolitical future of the \\nIndian Ocean rim and Eurasia. Unveiled by Chinese President Xi Jinping in the fall of 2013,2 \\n\\nwhat has since become known as the Belt and Road Initiative (though still sometimes \\nreferred to as \\u201cOne Belt, One Road\\u201d) is a long-term effort by Beijing to link together parts \\nof Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe through building ports, rails, roads, pipelines, \\nand telecommunications networks, and other types of infrastructure. \\n\\nGeographically, BRI covers countries representing 65 percent of the world\\u2019s population and \\none-third of its economic output. China plans to spend a trillion dollars in support of the \\ninitiative, which at present encompasses two major parts: a \\u201c21st Century Maritime Silk \\nRoad\\u201d stretching from Southeast Asia across the Indian Ocean into the Mediterranean Sea; \\nand, a \\u201cSilk Road Economic Belt\\u201d extending across Eurasia with branches terminating in \\nPakistan, Europe, and potentially additional locations. 3 A \\u201cDigital New Silk Road\\u201d that \\n\\n* The views presented in this testimony are Daniel Kliman\\u2019s alone and do not represent those of CNAS or any other\\norganizations with which he holds an affiliation. He wishes to thank CNAS colleague Melodie Ha for conducting\\nresearch in support of this testimony. CNAS is partnering with the Sasakawa Peace Foundation (SPF) on a project\\nfocusing on how the United States and its allies and partners should respond to China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\\nOther entities with a general interest in BRI, such as the U.S. Government, the Government of Japan, and various U.S.\\ncorporations, are supporters of CNAS.

Yet BRI also reflects \\nseveral geostrategic and military considerations. First and foremost is President Xi Jinping\\u2019s \\nvision of national rejuvenation \\u2013a China predominant in Asia and the leading power globally \\nby 2049.5 Longstanding concerns about China\\u2019s energy dependence on vulnerable sea lines \\nof communication as well as a desire to stand up new China-centric international \\norganizations also motivate BRI.6 \\n\\nDespite some recent high-profile setbacks to several BRI projects, 7 China at present retains \\nthe initiative. And the United States should neither underestimate China\\u2019s ability to implement \\nthe vision articulated for BRI nor downplay the appeal of BRI to countries in dire need of \\ninvestment in physical and digital infrastructure. In late 2013, a lack of imagination prevented \\nthe United States from anticipating the scope and consequences of Beijing\\u2019s land reclamation \\nin the South China Sea, delaying a timely and vigorous response. By comparison, BRI is \\nunfolding over a far larger land and maritime expanse, and could have more sweeping \\nconsequences for the United States. \\n\\nGeostrategic and Military Implications of BRI\\n\\nGiven BRI\\u2019s enormous ambitions, even if many projects never fully deliver or fall through, it \\ncould still reshape the economic and geopolitical landscape of the Indian Ocean rim and \\nEurasia. Key geostrategic and military implications include: \\n\\nAccelerating the Demand for Chinese Power Projection. BRI increases China\\u2019s need to \\nproject military power abroad. As Chinese investment and workers flow into far-flung and \\nsometimes unstable regions, the demand for the People\\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to conduct \\nnoncombatant evacuations, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR), counter-\\nterrorism missions, and other activities that Chinese strategists call \\u201cmilitary operations \\nother than war\\u201d will grow.8 So will the demand on the PLA Navy (PLAN) to protect sea \\nlines of communication that connect the major nodes of the \\u201c21st Century Maritime Silk \\nRoad.\\u201d9 In turn, BRI will reinforce voices within the PLA calling for more investment in \\ncapabilities to project power abroad \\u2013 though preferences for what form this investment \\ntakes will likely differ by service. 10 \\n\\nFacilitating the Supply of Chinese Power Projection. Expanding the PLA\\u2019s presence \\noverseas will require a dedicated logistics network that goes beyond \\u201cpit stops\\u201d at \\ncommercial ports. The dual-use infrastructure that China constructs through BRI \\u2013 such as \\nports and airfields \\u2013 can serve as the building blocks for a more robust logistics network that \\nenables the PLA to deploy more regularly and at a larger scale into the Indian Ocean and \\nbeyond.11 Djibouti is a case in point, where China initially built a new commercial port and \\n\\n95Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nsubsequently secured agreement from the Djiboutian government to construct a nearby \\nmilitary facility.12 \\n\\nEnhancing China\\u2019s Diplomatic Leverage. China\\u2019s lending practices associated with BRI \\nat times deviate from global standards. In offering loans to countries at a level beyond their \\nability to repay, China has created debt traps that translate into financial leverage and \\npermanently unequal diplomatic relationships. This in turn gives China an opening to parlay \\ndual-use infrastructure constructed by its BRI investments into future military facilities that \\ncould provide a basis for projecting power in ways that go well beyond conducting non-\\ncombatant evacuations and counter-piracy.13 It also could enable China to compel indebted \\ncountries to support its larger geopolitical objectives on issues such as maritime disputes in \\nthe South China Sea and in multilateral forums like the United Nations. \\n\\nComplicating U.S. Military Operations. The expansion of the PLA\\u2019s presence overseas \\nthat BRI both accelerates and enables will pose new challenges for the U.S. military. In \\npeacetime, the United States and China will operate in close proximity, not only in new \\nmaritime locations such as the Indian Ocean, but also in new ways, such as conducting \\nmissions from bases in Djibouti that are less than 10 miles apart, 14 increasing the possibility \\nof accidents in a space that the \\u201cRules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime \\nEncounters\\u201d concluded by the U.S. Department of Defense and China\\u2019s Ministry of \\nNational Defense in 2014 likely does not cover.15 To the extent that BRI paves the way for \\nChina to station its submarines in the Indian Ocean region,16 it will increase the undersea \\nthreat to U.S. warships operating there. Lastly, China could ultimately seek to deploy \\ndestabilizing capabilities such as long-range anti-ship missiles to the bases or military access \\npoints that BRI facilitates. This would create on a small scale the type of anti-access and \\narea-denial (A2/AD) challenge confronting the United States in the Western Pacific, and \\nelevate the risk to U.S. naval assets in the event of conflict. \\n\\nImproving China\\u2019s Energy Security. Roughly 80 percent of China\\u2019s oil imports pass \\nthrough the Strait of Malacca.17 BRI presents China with an opportunity to improve its \\nenergy security over the long term through creating a web of pipelines and ports that bypass \\nthis potential maritime chokepoint. Key projects include the China-Pakistan Economic \\nCorridor (CPEC), which will allow China to transport Middle East oil from Gwadar to its \\nwestern provinces, as well as a trans-Burma oil pipeline.18 Coupled with a growing PLA \\npresence in the Indian Ocean, these new pipelines and ports will likely give Chinese leaders \\ngreater confidence in their ability to weather a maritime economic blockade in the event of a \\nconflict. \\n\\nBolstering China\\u2019s Digital Influence. International attention has primarily focused on \\nChina\\u2019s efforts to build roads, rails, and ports across the Indian Ocean rim and Eurasia, yet \\ndigital infrastructure has emerged as a major element of BRI. Beijing has begun including \\ncommunications connectivity in its investment plans. Digital infrastructural investment by \\nChina could pose a unique set of challenges, as Chinese companies have few qualms about \\nexercising censorship, eroding online privacy, or intercepting trade secrets at the behest of the \\ngovernment in Beijing.19 Moreover, in its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development \\nPlan, China has announced its intent to \\u201caccelerate the broad application of AI technologies in \\n\\n96Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\ncountries along the \\u2018One Belt, One Road.\\u2019\\u201d20 China could potentially glean large amounts of data \\nfrom the digital infrastructure constructed by BRI. This data could help to fuel China\\u2019s AI industry, \\nand also give its companies a potential edge engaging consumers in markets across the Indian Ocean \\nrim and Eurasia. \\n\\nAntagonizing India \\u2013 and Irritating Pakistan. BRI has amplified longstanding Indian \\nconcerns about Chinese encirclement. India has objected in particular to CPEC, which runs \\nthrough Kashmir, territory that both it and Pakistan claim. For India, the development of \\nthe Gwadar port \\u2013 a flagship project of CPEC \\u2013 also raises the prospect of a Chinese \\nmilitary foothold along its western approaches. As Indian anxieties about BRI have \\nincreased, it has accelerated efforts to strengthen ties with the United States and Japan. \\nFrom a U.S. perspective, this development reinforces regional stability; viewed from Beijing, \\nit fuels fear of regional containment. While antagonizing India, BRI has also begun to create \\nirritations in the China-Pakistan relationship. China has brought its own workers and \\ncompanies into Pakistan, doing comparatively little to build local capacity. And China has at \\ntimes attempted to impose strict conditions on lending that would undermine Pakistani \\nsovereignty. 21 Over time, BRI could make China an increasing target for local antipathy in \\nPakistan, perhaps reducing the level of popular dislike directed toward the United States. \\n\\nWeakening European Cohesion. Chinese investment into Europe associated with BRI has \\nexacerbated existing divisions pitting Western European states and Brussels \\u2013 the seat of the \\nEuropean Union (EU) \\u2013 against the less wealthy countries of Central and Eastern Europe. \\nThe EU\\u2019s leadership has displayed a cautious approach toward BRI, underscoring that it \\nmust \\u201cadhere to a number of principles including market rules and international standards.\\u201d22 \\nHowever, states in Central and Eastern Europe have embraced BRI, and in Hungary\\u2019s case, may \\nhave ignored European public tender requirements when awarding China with a high-speed railway \\ncontract. Chinese investment into Central and Eastern Europe has also translated into diplomatic \\nleverage, rendering European unity on key questions like how to manage China\\u2019s investment in high-\\ntechnology industries more challenging. Overall, BRI will likely reduce Europe\\u2019s capacity to function \\nas a unified partner in any American response to address China\\u2019s mercantilist trade and investment \\npractices.23 \\n\\nThe United States and BRI\\n\\nThe United States has yet to develop a coherent strategy toward BRI. During President \\nObama\\u2019s tenure in the White House, BRI occupied a minor place in the hierarchy of issues \\nthat made up U.S. China policy. Other issues dominated the Obama administration\\u2019s focus \\non Beijing. On the cooperative side, addressing climate change, promoting global economic \\ndevelopment, and ensuring support for UN Security Council sanctions against Iran received \\npriority. On the competitive side, countering Beijing\\u2019s construction and subsequent \\nmilitarization of artificial island outposts in the South China Sea absorbed the attention of \\nsenior officials. Consequently, the Obama administration never formalized a view of BRI. \\nEven so, its commitment to strengthen regional connectivity \\u2013 as manifested in multiple \\ninitiatives spanning Central, South, and Southeast Asia \\u2013 and drive to boost U.S. investment \\nacross the Indo-Pacific functioned as a de facto response. \\n\\n97Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nAlthough the Trump administration has yet to unveil a systematic response to BRI, it is clear \\nthat over the coming years, BRI will occupy a comparatively prominent place in U.S. policy \\ntoward China on the competitive side of the relationship. Senior administration officials \\nincluding the Secretaries of State and Defense have publicly criticized BRI.24 President \\nTrump has yet to directly address BRI in public remarks. However, in his speech at the \\nAPEC CEO Summit in November 2017, he delivered a thinly-veiled critique, calling for \\nalternatives to \\u201cstate-directed initiatives that come with many strings attached.\\u201d25 Without \\nreferencing BRI by name, the Trump administration\\u2019s new National Security Strategy \\nacknowledges a \\u201cgeopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of world order \\ntaking place in the Indo-Pacific region,\\u201d calling out China\\u2019s role in using economic \\ninducements and infrastructure investments to pursue its geopolitical aspirations.26 \\n\\nThe Trump administration has started to sketch out limited elements of a U.S. approach \\ntoward BRI. At the APEC CEO Forum in November, President Trump announced that the \\nUnited States would reform its development finance institutions to create new incentives for \\nprivate sector investments. He has also urged international financial institutions (IFIs) to \\ndedicate greater resources to large-scale infrastructure projects. \\n\\nThus far, the most promising aspect of the Trump administration\\u2019s evolving response to \\nBRI is growing cooperation with allies and partners. During the president\\u2019s November trip \\nto Asia, his administration announced that the U.S. Overseas Private Investment \\nCorporation (OPIC) would join with Japanese partners \\u201cto offer high-quality United States-\\nJapan infrastructure investment alternatives in the Indo-Pacific region.\\u201d27 Moreover, BRI \\nappears to have been a topic of discussion in recent senior level meetings with India, as well \\nas the revived US-Japan-Australia-India four-way talks, also known as the Quad.28 Overall, \\nthe Trump administration appears inclined to develop a robust strategic response to BRI. \\nYet whether the Trump administration can fully execute a response to BRI is uncertain given \\nits budgetary priorities and predisposition against multilateral organizations. \\n\\nGuidelines for a U.S. Strategic Response\\n\\nUltimately, a U.S. response toward BRI must occur within the larger context of a positive \\nAmerican strategy to sustain the rules-based international order that since the end of World \\nWar II has underpinned global peace, prosperity, and democracy expansion. Recognizing this, \\nthe United States should seek to shape BRI to align with accepted international norms and \\nstandards; pursue opportunities for selective cooperation with China; and compete where \\nrequired. \\n\\nThe following guidelines provide a basis for developing a U.S. response to BRI: \\n\\nAvoid a purely oppositional approach. The United State should learn the lesson of its failed \\nopposition to China\\u2019s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB): countries need new \\nsources of investment, and are unlikely to be persuaded that they should reject additional \\nopportunities for economic development based on abstract arguments over international \\nprinciples. BRI fills a void left by traditional international financial institutions. Moreover, \\nBRI\\u2019s activities run the gamut from predatory lending to investments that would pass muster \\n\\n98Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nunder global norms. BRI is not a monolith, and treating it as such will make it more difficult \\nto impose necessary scrutiny on those investments that deserve careful review. \\n\\nOffer a positive vision \\u2013 one that includes China. The United States should advance an \\naffirmative vision of high-quality physical and digital infrastructure linking together Asia, \\nAfrica, the Middle East, and Europe in shared growth and preparation for the economy of the \\nfuture. Washington should emphasize that development financing should expand \\nopportunities \\u2013 not constrict national choices through unsustainable debt or degrade national \\nsovereignty through terms that ultimately compel countries to cede control of critical \\ninfrastructure. American officials should articulate that they welcome a more connected Indian \\nOcean rim and Eurasia in which China serves as one of multiple major nodes in a network of \\nphysical and digital infrastructure constructed not only by China, but also by a diverse set of \\nstates. \\n\\nPlace U.S. allies and partners at the center. The United States should seek to incorporate \\nkey allies and partners into the planning and execution of a strategy toward BRI. Their \\ninterests and concerns should inform and undergird a U.S. approach, not least because the \\nUnited States alone cannot effectively respond to BRI given its vast geographic and financial \\nscope. When identifying the most promising countries to involve in this effort, the United \\nStates should focus on allies and partners with sufficient resources and stature to chart their \\nown approach toward BRI regardless of Chinese economic inducements or coercion. Here, \\nJapan, India, Europe, Australia, and Saudi Arabia stand out. This collection of allies and \\npartners will naturally have different perspectives and equities when responding to BRI, and \\nthe United States should provide a platform to facilitate information exchange and an \\nalignment of approaches where possible. \\n\\nShape Chinese overseas basing. With BRI both accelerating and enabling the PLA\\u2019s \\noperations abroad, the United States and its allies and partners should identify where a \\nChinese military presence would be most destabilizing and take action to prevent it or at least \\nmitigate the consequences. For the United States, this will likely mean focusing more on BRI \\ninvestments along the Indian Ocean rim than those in Central Asian states. The United States \\nand its allies and partners should convey to countries considering granting China military \\naccess the potential consequences for their sovereignty, as well as types of PLA capabilities \\nthat would prove most disruptive. Congressional Delegations could play an important role in \\ncommunicating these concerns to political decision makers in states where China is pursuing \\nmilitary access. \\n\\nEnsure the U.S. military can operate in A2/AD environments. To the extent that BRI \\neventually paves the way for a network of overseas Chinese military facilities that feature some \\noffensive capabilities, the United States could in the future confront on a limited scale the type \\nof A2/AD challenge that today defines the Western Pacific. It is therefore essential that the \\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) continues to invest in new capabilities and develops new \\noperational concepts that will allow U.S. forces to effectively operate in A2/AD \\nenvironments. A U.S. military designed to fight and prevail in the Western Pacific will be able \\nto handle the comparatively modest A2/AD capabilities that China might deploy to future \\nfacilities in the Indian Ocean. Congress can play an important role in ensuring that the DoD \\n\\n99Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nmaintains an adequate focus on the force modernization required to prepare the U.S. military \\nto operate in a highly contested environment. \\n\\nFocus on digital infrastructure. U.S. companies have a comparative advantage in the digital \\ndomain, and the potential implications of the information technology dimension of BRI are \\nmost uncertain \\u2013 and potentially most consequential over the long term. The United States \\nand its allies and partners should consider launching a Digital Development Bank that would \\nspecialize in digital infrastructure and ensure that countries in the Indian Ocean rim and \\nEurasia have alternatives to a Faustian digital financing bargain with China. \\n\\nIn recent years, ambitious Chinese initiatives have too often caught the United States \\nflatfooted. Now is the time to develop a strategic response to BRI. In the absence of a \\ncoordinated approach that brings together the United States and its allies and partners, large \\nparts of the Indian Ocean rim and Eurasia could become the core of a new China-centric \\norder in which many states have little choice but to follow Beijing\\u2019s lead. \\n\\n1 This testimony draws on Daniel Kliman and Harry Krejsa, \\u201cResponding to China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative,\\u201d CNAS \\nCommentary, November 13, 2017, https://www.cnas.org/press/press-note/cnas-commentary-responding-to-chinas-\\nbelt-and-road-initiative; and Daniel Kliman and Manpreet S.

Chairman Cleveland. \\nCHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  I have a question for each of you.  Mr. Ratner, you \\n\\ndescribed the term burden-shifting, which I think is interesting, and you said that you thought \\nthat we should unilaterally--you may have used the word \\\"force,\\\"--compel, urge, encourage \\nChina to assume the burden of security responsibilities.  Can you describe where you mean that \\nbecause it's kind of a departure from what I would think of in terms of where I'd want China \\npositioned? \\n\\nAnd then the second issue--I'll turn to the second issue after you respond to that. \\nDR. RATNER:  Well, I guess a generic point and a specific point.  The generic \\n\\npoint is we should take a hard look at looking where we feel like as it relates to security and \\nstabilization, we are overextended.  Look at where China's interests are emergent and \\nintensifying and where we think that their perception or conception of what they would want is at \\nleast with the bounds of something that we wouldn't consider a major national security threat \\nanyway. \\n\\nSo if one were to draw that, I think the first place I would look would be \\nAfghanistan.  I think the fact that the United States is spending billions of dollars to build up the \\nAfghanistan military and secure that country when it is surrounded by a whole region that has \\nvital security interests there, and we are bearing the diplomatic and military and human costs of \\nthat alongside the Afghan people is quite extraordinary. \\n\\nAnd I think Beijing has shown that it has more interests there.  There were reports \\nin the last several weeks that they were setting up--it's unclear exactly--but something along the \\nlines of some facilities in eastern Afghanistan, and I think the United States should think \\nseriously about talking to but also telling partners in the region, including working through the \\nShanghai Cooperation Organization, but directly to Beijing, that there are parts of Afghanistan \\nthat they will be responsible for stabilizing at Year X.  \\n\\nWhether it's one year or two years or three years from now, I would defer to the \\nmilitary commanders about how much time it would take to appropriately withdraw U.S. forces, \\nbut I think that's the kind of mentality we need to be in rather than sinking again tens of billions \\nof dollars into Afghanistan while China literally works around it to undermine the liberal order \\nand impose their own interests. \\n\\nCHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  You do remember when we suggested this \\npreviously, and their interest was in protecting a, I think it was a copper mine. It was some \\ninvestment that they had, and that was the limit of their interest in this issue.  So I think it's an \\ninteresting--it presents an interesting question in the moment. \\n\\nDr. Kliman, would you describe a little more--I like the term \\\"debt trap,\\\" and as \\nyou may have heard this morning, I'm very interested in sort of the terms of loans that are being \\nextended by the various Chinese policy banks, and how there is a presumption, I think, baked in \\nof risk because they see that this isn't just a financing mechanism.  It's an opportunity to secure \\nassets in the event that the loan doesn't pay off exactly the way they envision. \\n\\nSo if you could describe some of the--perhaps some examples of where you see \\nthis risk of a debt trap and what the implications are? \\n\\nDR. KLIMAN:  Absolutely.  I want to, before answering that, take a step back, \\n\\n102102\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nand I think it's important to keep in context the criteria by which some of these investments were \\nmade, and they're not necessarily pure kind of return on investment, but there also are certainly \\ngeopolitical considerations. \\n So even if China doesn't make significant returns on investment, it gives it long-\\nterm leverage over a country, particularly one with some strategic geography, that may be a net \\nwin.  \\n To give you a few very concrete examples. One that is often raised, of course, is \\nSri Lanka where over time China rapidly built up certainly Sri Lanka's share of debt that was \\nowed to Beijing and was ultimately able to essentially parlay the Hambantota port in the \\nsouthern part of Sri Lanka into a 99-year lease.  India ultimately was able to come and take a \\nkind of nearby airport and make a financial bid so China did not get both the airport and the port.  \\nBut that's kind of one key example. \\n Djibouti is another where you saw rapid increase in Chinese debt over time.  \\nChina, of course, built the commercial port and then was able to build a military facility as well.  \\nSo two countries, again, where you've seen significant debt and then, at least in one, there has \\nalready been a military facility opened in Sri Lanka.  Obviously we'll see where that goes. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Can I pause you on this?  Do you think--I mean \\nBurma and Kyaukpyu comes to mind in terms of the trade for the dam if that was what actually \\ntranspired.  Do you think that there is a conversation about we're going to put this money on the \\ntable to build this facility, and if it works, it works, if it doesn't, it doesn't because we can then \\nleverage it?  I mean do you think this is a calculated kind of commercial, political, security \\ndecision, or do you think it's accidental? \\n DR. KLIMAN:  I would think it's--I don't know on a case-by-case basis.  I would \\nimagine some of this is simply incentivized for Chinese firms to go out and make these \\ninvestments and call it Belt and Road.  \\n I think there certainly is a logic behind it that although these may not always pay \\noff commercially, there may be a geopolitical payoff.  I personally don't have the insight into \\nkind of the decision-making that happens in these particular investments if there is a sort of let's \\nknow that there's not going to be any commercial payoff, but we'll get something geopolitical in \\nreturn. \\n I would say it's probably not seen as a negative for leadership in Beijing, but \\nwhether there's kind of a calculus that's very deliberate, I wouldn't know. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Okay.  Thank you.  I'll follow up. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay.  Thank you both.   \\n I have two questions which hopefully both of you could take a shot at answering \\nif you like. The first question deals with something you touched on in your testimony, Dr. \\nRatner: Russian-Chinese competition in Central Asia.  And many of these countries obviously \\nwere former Soviet republics and are in many respects culturally Russian.  \\n So my very high-level simplistic sense is that the Russians have ceded the \\neconomics to China in the Central Asian republics but have not ceded the security sphere, and \\nthe Chinese are careful about not offending Russian sensibilities on the security side.  So I'd like \\nyou to react to that.   \\n And the second question is something that you said, Dr. Kliman, that triggered a \\nthought, the Malacca Dilemma.  We hear that a lot of the BRI initiatives are the pipelines from \\nRussia, from Burma, from Central Asia are designed to solve or mitigate the Malacca Dilemma.   \\n But my sense is that they need so much oil, they need so much natural gas, that \\n\\n103103\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthe Malacca Dilemma will never be resolved through overland pipelines from Russia, Burma, \\nCentral Asia.  I'd like you to, I'd like you to comment on that. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Happy to go first on that.  So in terms of will BRI mitigate the \\nMalacca Dilemma, I would generally agree, I think at best partially, just given the sheer volume \\nof oil, and, yes, China can build ports and pipelines and overland routes in places like Burma or \\nPakistan. \\n My view would be that it at least provides--it would, it makes any kind of U.S. \\nmilitary operations potentially more challenging where there are more areas that would require \\nfocus in terms of the maritime domain, and so it does, in that sense, complicate a little bit, but it's \\nnot going to necessarily kind of wean China off kind of the Malacca Strait.  \\n Probably at the end of the day, China's best bet is the kind of clean energy \\ninvestments they're making now, which over the long-term are designed to make their economy \\nless reliant on oil writ large, whether it's imported from sort of ports in Burma or through the \\nMalacca Strait. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Thank you.   \\n Dr. Ratner. \\n DR. RATNER:  Yeah, I would generally agree with that point.  I think the \\ndiversification of China's energy sources have been long underway prior to BRI, and it has an \\neconomic logic to it and otherwise.  I think they're looking to alleviate sources of vulnerability, \\nand this won't resolve, but it is part of that. \\n But it also goes to the earlier point that I made that what, again, from a purely \\nmilitary perspective what matters or not is if the United States can menace the People's \\nLiberation Army in East Asia and in the South China Sea, and whether the closing of the \\nMalacca Straits affects their energy security may matter on the margins in a long-term military \\nconflict, but what we are at risk of here and what the United States government should be \\nfocused on is preventing China from pushing out a sphere of influence and effective control over \\ncertainly the South China Sea, if not other parts of their eastern littoral. \\n So I think that's the real challenge, and again if you believe what Secretary Mattis \\nsaid last Friday, that military advantage is eroding, and that will be much more--whether the \\nUnited States can and is willing to fight will ultimately be what matters here and not whether \\nChina is going to be willing to pull or able to pull energy through the Malacca Strait.  But I think \\nit is part of an overall vulnerability mitigation strategy. \\n As it relates to the Russia question, this is a good example of where the BRI piece \\nof this is part of a much larger question about how does the United States think about its strategic \\ncompetition with China and where does Russia play into that, and how do we think about \\nmitigating the potential for Russian-Chinese collusion, which exists already, which I think will \\nonly happen if we force those two together because they do have shared interest, but they're not \\nnatural allies. \\n And I think this is a reason why again just thinking practically about \\nrecommendations, to the extent that the United States can shed light on the types of activities that \\nare actually involved in BRI, I think that can be a useful way to ensure that the Russians are on \\nthe right side of this and in an area where I think the U.S. government would be, which would be \\nnot wanting to see undue Chinese influence rather than seeing Chinese partnership in this. \\n So I think shining a light and the transparency is really important, not only for the \\nrecipient countries but for some of these strategic dynamics as well. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay.  Thank you. \\n\\n104104\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n Dr. Tobin. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, gentlemen. \\n I'm going to approach my questions--I have three for you, Dr. Ratner, and I think \\non a second round, I have several specific for you, Dr. Kliman, and I'm sure we'll have enough \\ntime this morning. \\n So, Dr. Ratner, your recommendations for U.S. policy were, I felt, outstanding, \\nand I want to give you an opportunity to orally tell us a little bit more about three of them, \\nplease. \\n You just mentioned the one about rebuild institutions for U.S. information \\noperations so that we can lay out the facts and the fictions of the Belt and Road Initiative to make \\npeople who are receiving some of these potential--what would you say--opportunities from \\nChina better understand what's going on. \\n So I'd like you to just spin that out a little bit more.  Tell us how it would work, \\nwhat the United States could do, could one, two, three be set up?  Who would run it?  That's the \\nfirst piece. \\n The second piece is shortly after that you mentioned capacity-building for \\nrecipient countries, and there you talked about establishing something that could be quite \\nstraightforward, a clearinghouse of best practices or a forum to assess BRI projects.  If you could \\ntalk about that. \\n And lastly, TPP.  As you know, both sides of the aisle have in the last political \\nyears have pulled away from that.  How would you urge the United States players to consider \\nrejoining or reshaping or will it make sense at all? \\n Thank you. \\n DR. RATNER:  Great.  Thank you. \\n Those are all terrific questions.  On the question of U.S. information operations, \\nto be concrete, the Broadcasting Board of Governors has started a 24/7 cable news Russian \\nchannel that has a very significant social media platform as well.  As I understand it, during the \\nIran protests, Voice of America and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, some of their \\nplatforms were some of the most viewed in the world, including in Iran and in China. \\n So they are, in my view, having seen a presentation on this recently, I was, I \\nshouldn't say surprised, but happy to see how sophisticated they were in terms of the people who \\nwere in charge there.  They're real communication specialists.  They're thinking hard about how \\nto use data and who their audiences are, and this has been--this effort is focused at broadly \\naddressing the issue of Russian information operations and misinformation operations around the \\nworld. \\n Obviously we have that problem here in the United States.  That's not their writ.  \\nBut they have been, I think by their account, quite effective in the information space as it relates \\nto Russia, and we ought to be doing the same as it relates to China because China has an even \\nmore sophisticated, I think, and even more comprehensive set of information operations and \\nsystems around the world, and again the story of that, those information operations, is China's \\nascendant, China is the future, America is a mess, and the United States is in decline, and so you \\nbetter get on our side or you're going to pay for it. \\n And I think the reality is obviously much more complicated than that, and my \\nunderstanding is the White House is in discussions with the Broadcasting Board of Governors to \\nthink about what is a China element to this, and you all ought to do what you can to support that. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  So would it be expanding their current charter \\n\\n105105\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nor is it within their charter as far as you know? \\n DR. RATNER:  It's within their charter.  It would be more resources dedicated to \\nI think areas of, areas where we have concern about illiberal Chinese influence, and the goal \\nwould be to provide objective news, either in local language or in Chinese language as well.  So I \\nthink that's something we could do. \\n Along with that, I would argue that the public affairs and public diplomacy parts \\nof our bureaucracy have atrophied certainly since the end of the Cold War.  But we have very \\ncapable people working in the public affairs bureaus and the Under Secretary for Public \\nDiplomacy at the State Department, but I think if you were to go and look at their activities, it's a \\nlot of soft people-to-people social programs that aren't integrated with strategic communications \\nis how we would think about it.  \\n And so it would be useful for--I think this would have to be a White House-led \\neffort, but to the extent that we use the term \\\"strategic communications\\\" within the White House, \\nit's not just about what the President is going out and saying.  It's about coordinating strategic \\nmessaging that's professional and driven by people who understand these things, not necessarily \\nsomeone who has just come from their latest job at an embassy doing political work, but a real \\ncommunication specialist coordinating messages, getting them to the right people, and using our \\npublic affairs offices at the Pentagon and the State Department to their full effect. \\n So I think there's a lot of work to be done there.  I think frankly the administration \\nis aware of this, and they're focused on it, but it will take more resources and it will take better \\ninteragency coordination than we've seen to date.  So that's on that point. \\n On the second, the issue of capacity-building for recipient countries, I think, I \\nguess one area where I would take a slightly different approach than Dr. Kliman in terms of his \\nassessment of the AIIB.  I wasn't in government at the time so I'm not saying this to defend what \\nthe Obama administration did.   \\n But you could argue that was a diplomatic failure because the United States was \\nleft on the outside looking in, had a lot of egg on its face as its partners flocked to the AIIB. \\n On the other hand, the types of issues that say the liberal industrialized countries \\nwere urging China to take on, they largely did.  They diluted their shares due to international \\npressure. Their projects, that actually the influence of the bank and the number of projects \\nthey've done have moved more slowly than I think they would like because they're adhering to \\nhigher standards that others imposed upon them. \\n So I think that's an important lesson insofar as Beijing's efforts can be shaped in \\nthis regard with sufficient international coordination and international pressure.  So there's a case \\nmaybe Washington and the administration didn't handle it as well as they could have, but the end \\nresult was largely where we were hoping. \\n And I think the same could be done with BRI if organizations like the G7 I think \\nwould be a place to have these conversations.  Some of the larger ASEAN organizations, the \\nEast Asia Summit potentially, certainly within the U.S.-ASEAN summits that we hold annually, \\nas well as the Quad, the newly revised Quad mechanism between the United States, Japan, \\nAustralia and India.   \\nI think all of these are places where groups can get together, get the experts together, and have a \\nset of, again, as I described it and as you described it, best practices or a place where human \\ncapital can be provided from--to look at some of these deals. \\n I will say part of the problem, of course, is that some of these recipient countries \\nfor their own political and economic reasons will want to go ahead with these projects whether \\n\\n106106\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthey're economically viable or not. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n DR. RATNER:  So this isn't a fail-proof solution and it's not as if the recipient \\ncountries are the saints and the Chinese are always the antagonists here.  So I think that's-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  But it is a voice. \\n DR. RATNER:  It's not 100 percent solution. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n DR. RATNER:  But, again, it's important. \\n As relates to the TPP question, it's very hard, you know.  It will, I think it will \\nhonestly take strong leadership from American politicians to make the case that, number one, \\nagain, we are in a consequential strategic competition with China that it will down the road affect \\nthe wealth and security and prosperity and freedom of the American people and their children \\nand their grandchildren in subsequent generations if we don't get serious here. \\n And that that is the lens through which we should look at the Trans-Pacific \\nPartnership, and if there are negative externalities as it relates to opening our markets, there are \\nways that we can deal with that through domestic policies, and there are people looking at that, \\nand free trade, I think it has been assessed certainly from now going forward is not the answer \\nhere.  And, in fact, setting higher standards is standing up for the American people, and, frankly, \\nas a Democrat, quite disappointing to see Democrats make a progressive--I know this isn't a \\npartisan commission--but to see Democrats making an argument against what was largely a \\nprogressive deal that would have raised standards for women and children and the environment \\nhigher than 50 years of American diplomacy will do on its own waving its hand and through the \\nUSAID. \\n So I think there is a case to be made.  It will take political leadership, and it will \\ntake a larger sense of the meaningfulness of the strategic competition with China. \\n Just the last thing I'll say on this is that obviously the Trump administration has \\nelevated the issue of China's unfair trade practices to the front burner, and I think we've already \\nseen the solar panels case decided upon.  Steel and aluminum are coming down the pike.  And \\nthe then the 301 case as it relates to intellectual property and other unfair practices I think will be \\ncoming next. \\n We can play defense all we want.  The way you solve those problems is by \\nworking with your partners to set standards around some of those issues, and that's what TPP \\nwas.  So I think there is enough strategic logic and economic logic and otherwise that if the \\ndomestic politics can be alleviated through other programs that TPP still makes all the sense in \\nthe world. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you very much. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Commissioner Stivers. \\n COMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Thank you.  Thank you both for being here today \\nand for your excellent remarks. \\n You both mentioned the need for--the tremendous need for a positive and you \\nsaid comprehensive and competitive China strategy.  I would modify that a little bit to make sure \\nit's an Asia strategy.  I think it's important.   \\n And the policy options I think moving forward have to be both in the diplomatic \\nand development components.  I think we have a twofold challenge, and you both have worked \\nin the administration, and I think you can shed some good insight on this.  How do we bring this \\nU.S. government together?  You know, diplomacy and international development are two totally \\n\\n107107\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\ndifferent disciplines, you know. \\n Diplomacy is focused on building stronger and positive relationships.  \\nDevelopment is focused on saving lives and lifting people out of poverty and creating kind of the \\nunderlying prosperity and stability that we think is not only in the U.S. interests, but it's in \\neveryone's interests. \\n But there's a real lack of overlap in those two worlds.  Development, there's 15 \\ngovernment agencies that do development--more than that, I think.  Most of them don't work in \\nChina.  They don't--shouldn't work in China.  They don't work in China, and they don't have \\nChina expertise in them. \\n And then you have a lot of the folks that, you know, they're experts on China that \\nfocus I think more on the security and trade realms.  And so you really have this disconnect \\nbetween two worlds where I think a lot of the solutions or the policy options to compete with \\nChina are actually in the development world, but I don't think those folks are thinking \\nstrategically about China.  They're trying to save people's lives as they should be because that's \\ntheir job. \\n So how, you know, how does the administration bring these worlds together, and \\nthen what's the role of Congress for that?  I mean should there be a bill that, you know, that can \\ncreate the strategy or mandate that the administration put this strategy together with these \\ncomponents? \\n Does there need to be something like a competing-with-China-influence fund \\nwhere we provide the resources to countries in Asia to--on civil society, on these sorts of things \\nthat can push back on some of these things?  So that's my first question. \\n My second question--I'll just throw this out there--is on the diplomacy side.  You \\nalso can bring your allies and partners together on this, too, and, you know, should there be an \\neconomic component of the Quad?  And how receptive are the countries of the Quad going to be \\nto that, especially if it's seen as something that counters China?  And do you think, have you seen \\nin your work that they're moving in this direction or that's been on the table in the Quad \\ndiscussions? \\n Who wants to start? \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Great.  I'm happy to take at least some of that on.  All really great \\nquestions.   In terms of bridging the divide between diplomacy and development, I would say \\nmy hope--we'll see if it plays out--is that the kind of elevation of long-term competition with \\nChina in this new national security strategy will trickle down.  It's obviously incumbent on \\npeople at the White House to ensure that people, you know, all the different bureaucracies are \\nsocialized into that.  \\n But that ultimately I think having a fairly clear guidance from the top on this is \\nkind of U.S. strategy, we are competing with China, you should think of your activities in that \\ncontext and not in a simply let's do good for the world although that's important.  I think that will \\nbe at least useful. \\n One other piece is trying to encourage, and maybe there's a role for Congress in \\nthis, but trying to encourage more China expertise to go into places like USAID.  It's often very \\nhard to get people with China expertise into national security bureaucracies.  They shockingly \\nspend time in China often or have family backgrounds, and so it may be easier in some ways to \\nopen up the development space to folks who want to serve, and it may be hard for them to go \\ninto the kind of national security side of the government. \\n So I think there may be opportunities there to creatively bring more talent in, and \\n\\n108108\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nif you can essentially be kind of building on the sort of supply side more China expertise in \\ndevelopment, and then have the demand signal from the White House in national security \\nstrategy to help people understand that there is a competition, that may be positive.  \\n Also, even in terms of budgets, I think right now everybody is trying to justify \\ntheir budget, especially if you are in the development space.  And so there may be a national \\ntendency to grab onto competition with China, and so that may be a sort of positive externality of \\nsome of the what I would say are unfortunate proposed cuts.  But it may drive people in that \\ndirection on the development side. \\n In terms of the role of Congress, it was a really interesting question you had about \\nhave a compete-with-China fund.  You certainly could wonder whether there would be a way to \\ncreate sort of a pool of funding across the U.S. government where ideas for competition, whether \\nit was in the sort of information space or other kinds of creative opportunities, could almost like \\npitch each year ideas, and then that would be funded. \\n I think that would be helpful.  Often there's a lot of ideas, but there's not sort of a \\nbody of funding that moves quickly, and so having sort of surge grants or surge funding could be \\nvery useful, especially trying to empower people on the front lines of U.S. foreign policy who \\nwill see opportunities but often there's no way for them to move funds around quickly enough to \\nperhaps seize on the opportunities that present themselves. \\n In terms of the kind of economic cooperation with the Quad, I'll admit I'm a little \\nbit skeptical in part knowing sort of several members of the Quad.  U.S. bilateral economic \\ncooperation with India, obviously there's a lot of long-term potential.  It's an uphill slog.  We still \\ndon't have a bilateral investment treaty.  \\n It seems hard to imagine kind of with the configuration of those four you're going \\nto get a lot certainly sort of more trade liberalization among the four.  I think perhaps the more \\nopportunity for the Quad if you look beyond sort of the hard security might be in more capacity \\nbuilding, even kind of development.  Somebody is looking at how do you export models of \\nentrepreneurial development and technology assistance.  I mean to me that's much more feasible \\nthan perhaps sort of enhancing trade liberalization among those four. \\n DR. RATNER:  I'll just take a quick, just a quick intervention, to say 100 percent \\nagree on the Asia strategy.  That's absolutely right.  China strategy is Asia strategy, and often we \\nget it the other way around to our own detriment.  And, yes, comprehensive means diplomatic \\nand economic and development, and I think the point I was trying to make earlier, we have to be \\nfiring on all cylinders to get this right, that if we think of the security challenges of BRI in a \\nnarrow military lane, we're not going to have the influence that we need and the resources and \\npower to bend the curve on this. \\n The only other thing I would say in addition to what Dan said is I think there's a \\nrelationship between the diplomacy and the development.  I think the other, perhaps the most, the \\nmore fruitful area, at least in the short term, is thinking about getting more China watching and \\nmore China expertise out of just the East Asia bureaus because we have things happening like \\nwhen the Chinese flipped Panama on their diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and all of a sudden \\nit's, well, who was--do we have a China watcher in our embassy in Panama City, and the answer \\nis no. \\n And I think--and I know this is something that the last administration and the, \\nparticularly the policy planning they were thinking about, and they may have made some \\nheadway on, but we ought to have China experts in the places where these projects are \\nhappening, looking very closely and understanding what's going on.  Because otherwise a lot of \\n\\n109109\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthis is going to happen, and it's going to be too late before we realize what's going on. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Thank you. \\n Senator Talent. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  I had a little trouble coming up with questions \\nbecause there isn't a single thing either one of you said that I disagreed with.  I just thought it was \\nbrilliant except I share a little bit of the skepticism about the risk-sharing piece, what you said, \\nDr. Ratner. \\n So I'm going to take this down a little bit different direction.  It is very frustrating \\nthat there are so many things we could be doing that are well within our capabilities to do and \\nwe're not doing them.  You mentioned the South China Sea, Dr. Ratner.  That to me is the \\nnecessary but not sufficient condition of any successful policy.  If we get pushed out of that area, \\nit doesn't matter what else we do. \\n And I think one of the problems here--so now I put on my old hat, and I say to \\nmyself, you know, the difficulty with this is going back to Monett, Missouri or the Bootheel or \\nColumbia or the south side of St. Louis city, and explain to people why it matters to them in \\nterms that make a difference to them? \\n So you all have talked about the norm-based international order, and I completely \\nget it and completely support it.  But what would this mean to my former constituents in a real \\nsense?  If China succeeds in the national competition, overturns the norm-based international \\norder, at least in Asia, what difference does it make?  What could I say to them in terms of what \\ndoes it mean for your pocketbook, your family's security? \\n And I know you can't be exact about this, but some reasonable speculation good \\nenough for political purposes.  You know, so what, how does it matter to them?  Because I think \\nif the people who normally sit around this dais can explain that, then we can get the kind of \\ncommitment that we need. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yes.  Good point. \\n DR. RATNER:  Do you want to start? \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Sure.  We'll see if we can give you something to distribute, \\nSenator. \\n [Laughter.] \\n DR. KLIMAN:  If you look at, I mean it's interesting, if you look at the kind of \\ndawn of the Cold War, there was a very deliberate effort by the Truman administration to sort of \\nvery much simplify and distill the Soviet threat in terms everyone could understand, sometimes \\nperhaps even exaggerate aspects.  So I don't think we want to go in that direction. \\n But in terms of how we could kind of distill it for the American people, in some \\nways I think we're at potentially the right time where we've loosely touched on some of the \\nChina kind of trade and investment challenges that this administration is beginning to take action \\non, and to me that speaks very much more kind of to people's pocketbook, and it's that do you \\nwant to live in a world where China doesn't play by the rules and your livelihood and those of \\nyour children are less versus a world in which all countries, including the U.S., play by the same \\nrules, and your, kind of your labor will result in you get what you deserve as opposed to China \\nkind of cheats, and ultimately it's going to harm you and your descendants? \\n And so I think the economic piece is maybe a little easier to sort of convey.  I \\nagree when we talk about a rules-based international order, it's more challenging. \\n I do think, though, aside from the economic piece, there's an important values \\ncomponent, and then ultimately at the end of the day, I mean this country stands for bringing \\n\\n110110\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\ndignity and certainly more choice and freedom to those beyond our borders and that the sort of \\nworld that China would look to construct would be very much one in which certainly the dignity \\nof all people is not respected, that people have fewer choices about their own lives, and that you \\nwould see a very different and darker world, one in which our values that we've certainly \\nchampioned for our country's existence are no longer moving forward but actually retrenching. \\n So I would say the economic piece perhaps is most compelling, but at least in my \\nheart I would like to say that the values piece also will resonate. \\n DR. RATNER:  Yeah, I'm just going to build on--Senator, it's a terrific question, \\nand it's one that a lot of folks are talking about behind closed doors in Washington right now \\nthinking about how do we make the case because generic statements about American leadership \\nand liberal order are not going to be enough. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  And I should add I'm not accusing my people back \\nin Missouri of just not getting it or something.  I don't think we've ever explained it. \\n DR. RATNER:  That's right.  That's right. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  I mean I think when you explain it to them, I used \\nto get in arguments because I was on the SASC, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because they'd say, you \\nknow, the American people just won't support--yes, they will.  But you have to explain what it \\nmeans to them.  \\n But I interrupted.  Go ahead. \\n DR. RATNER:  No, and that's right, and I think it's notable that the Rebalance to \\nAsia was a marquee legacy policy of the Obama administration and he never spoke to the \\nAmerican people about it, whereas he went on how many times did he go on prime time and talk \\nabout Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan?  So I think the communication of this from the very top \\nall the way down, from you all sitting here, from members of Congress, from people who have \\nthe time to think and research about this, is really important. \\n To answer your question specifically, because I've thought a lot about this, and \\nyou get this challenge a lot--again, it's a group challenge, not otherwise--the answer in my mind \\nis you got to start at the end and work backwards because the China challenge is so incremental \\nand it's so multifaceted that any one piece of it is hard to wrap around your finger and tell you \\nwhy it matters.  \\n And so what you have to do is you have to put people in the future of a China-led \\norder and make them understand what that looks and feels like and why they're not going to like \\nit. \\n And Nad\\u00e8ge Rolland, who was on the panel earlier here, she had a great \\nmonograph on the Belt and Road in which--actually, she has a full chapter dedicated to \\ndescribing what Eurasia looks like--I don't know what the year is--2025 or 2030--if China fulfills \\nits economic and political ambitions in that region, and it's pretty sobering. \\n And I think it does get back to, you know, for hundreds of years, the United States \\nhas tried to prevent a rival hegemon in Eurasia so as to allow trade and investment and ideas to \\nflow West and prevent security threats from flowing in this direction.  And we have a forward \\ndeployed military so that we can keep threats there and not here, and again that's probably not \\ngoing to sell in Missouri, but it's a reality we have to consider. \\n For things that will sell, I will say on the economic front, markets will be closed \\nto American businesses, and China's industrial policies will bankrupt and run American \\nbusinesses out of business, and you will have Chinese champion technology firms in a number of \\nareas, to which they're--you heard this on the earlier panel--they're being completely transparent \\n\\n111111\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nabout their goal to do just that.  \\n And so if we want our economy, our conceptions of being at the cutting edge of \\ninnovation and technology, then this is really going to matter.  And I would just, I think the--I \\nwould maybe take, not to exaggerate the point, but I would take Dan's comments about values \\none step further because it's not just about other people overseas, right? \\n I mean what we're seeing in the United States today is that Hollywood is \\ncensoring their movies because they don't want to lose economic opportunity in China; \\nnewspapers are censoring, self-censoring the reporting they're doing on Xi Jinping and the \\nregime because they want to have their websites up in China; universities and professors are \\ncensoring what they write; they're censoring the classes they teach.  Think tanks as well because \\nof the money they're getting. \\n And I don't think your average citizen in Missouri loves that.  We had a situation \\nhere where a valedictorian at the University of Maryland gave a speech--a Chinese national--in \\nwhich she said, you know, she tasted the air of freedom here in the United States.  She got \\ndecimated by the Chinese government itself in official statements, by social media in China, and \\nI think the question is--again, not to exaggerate the point--but do we want ourselves and our \\nchildren to live in a world where what we see on TV, in the news, in the movies, is \\nfundamentally free or not?  And that to me is what this whole thing is about. \\n COMMISSIONER TALENT:  I think that's a great statement, and I'll yield in a \\nsecond.  I absolutely think that the folks back home will support what we need to do to prevent \\nthat.  The problem is when we use terms like \\\"norm-based international\\\" and don't describe it to \\nthem, and don't explain it, then they default to what they are hearing.   \\n And they think that that means foreign aid or it means some big company, you \\nknow, gets to send a factory someplace else.  And so you just, you have to take it down to a level \\nof granularity. And again, in their defense, we have trouble saying what it means, right?  And \\nwe're on this Commission, and you guys study this--right--and then we expect folks back home \\nto just sort of pick up on it. \\n I couldn't.  It's mystifying--although I thought the rebalance policy was absolutely \\nthe right policy, but it was mystifying to me that the administration did not take that out and \\ncommunicate it better.  Maybe you could write a book about it some day and explain why.  I \\ndon't know. \\n [Laughter.] \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Thank you. \\n Co-Chair--Vice Chairman Bartholomew. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Thanks.  Thank you very much, \\ngentlemen, and interesting, thoughtful testimonies. \\nDr. Ratner, I too am kind of intrigued by what you were talking about, particularly in terms of \\nAfghanistan.  But and the reality of it is, of course, that China has built its economy and has built \\nits military under the U.S. national security umbrella.  And I think what you are putting out there \\nis we need to question whether this continues to make sense under for us in some locations.   \\n I'm not saying a retreat from the region or anything like that, but does it continue \\nto make sense for the U.S. to be paying money and blood in order to have China be the \\nbeneficiary of our presence in places, or is it time for them to step up to the plate, to be the global \\ncitizen?  So I think that that's really important. \\n I want to switch just a little bit on the security issues.  Some of the things that \\nhave happened, of course, as you say, the Chinese have been pretty open and clear about what \\n\\n112112\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nthey're doing, but as their presence is growing on the Belt and Road countries, it provides \\nmilitary opportunities that might be there.  Railroads allow you to move troops, for example, and \\nroads, you know, they make the movement of personnel and weaponry easier if you need it.  I \\nthink always of Tibet there in a context like that. \\n But are there places, places, for example, in Eastern Europe where you think that \\nthere are going to be challenges that the U.S. military is going to have to respond to because of \\nan increasing Chinese presence, and certainly in Eastern Europe, I would put an increasing \\nChinese/Russian presence? \\n I'm just trying to think, usually when we think of flashpoints, of course, we think \\nabout the South China Sea, but is an increased national security presence by the Chinese in other \\nregions along the Belt and Road going to cause potential military issues for us? \\n This is for both of you. \\n DR. RATNER:  I'll take a first crack and then pass it over to Dan.  I think in terms \\nof areas as far as Eastern Europe, I think the answer is no, that it is not that a Chinese foothold or \\naccess agreement is going to undermine the military advantage of the United States and NATO.  \\nWe're very far from that.   \\n The Chinese for a variety of reasons--this is a wholly separate topic--but their \\nforce projection capabilities are still, they're growing, but they're pretty nascent.  They're very \\nstrong along their littoral and in East Asia, but their ability to mobilize, much less fight, even if it \\nwere to be on the western end of the Indian Ocean, is very limited still for a variety of \\norganizational reasons, not just capability reasons. \\n So as it relates to Eastern Europe, I think we're still far away off from that.  I \\nthink, I guess what I would get back to earlier, which is I think we are seeing for sure some of \\nthe goodies of Belt and Road affecting decision-making in European capitals, and Greece is the \\nmost prominent example here where they threw themselves in front of a human rights resolution, \\nas far as I understand it, that was going to criticize China, an EU resolution, breaking the \\nconsensus there, which is quite remarkable.  And I think there are concerns as well about \\nHungary and other more liberal-leaning European countries being willing to sign up for this. \\n So I think the way that, the way that it matters for security reasons, as it relates to \\nthe United States, is that these economic projects, that there will be, there may be military access \\ncomponents to it, and I know this is a bit of a punt on your question, but it's the economic \\ninfluence that's going to buy the political influence that's going to shape decision-making in these \\ncapitals around security issues, whether it's the Iran deal or something related to incorporating \\nIndia into a multilateral organization or what's happening in North Korea sanctions or Russia \\nsanctions, to use your example. \\n So I think that's where the rubber is going to meet the road on security issues, at \\nleast over the next five years.  It's a long time before the PLA will be posing real operational \\nchallenges to the United States in Europe proper. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Dr. Kliman. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  So on Eastern Europe, I fully agree with Dr. Ratner.  The one \\nthing I would add is that you could imagine some of the frictions created by Chinese investment \\nunder BRI going into Eastern Europe will play to Russia's current strategy, which is also \\ntargeting many of these same countries, trying to divide the EU.  \\n So in that sense, perhaps not even deliberately, that China will in some ways \\nadvance Russia's strategy versus Europe, which is to sow division. \\n In terms of kind of other military points, I think it really depends on ultimately the \\n\\n113113\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\ntypes of capabilities that China deploys.  In Djibouti, certainly in the near future, to me the main \\nrisk would probably be those of accidents, that if the U.S. and Chinese militaries have bases \\nnearby or are operating in close proximity, we do have rules of behavior for air and maritime \\nencounters.  I don't think that quite extends or it would be interesting to see how folks in the U.S. \\ngovernment would interpret that when it comes to having bases in near proximity, which is a \\nnew challenge.  It's not something that we've had to deconflict before. So I think there is \\ncertainly the risk of accident. \\n Looking kind of at other locations of the world, Gwadar, I would say the \\nchallenge is probably more for India than the United States in the near term, that if China was to \\nput more military capability into Gwadar or nearby, it would certainly serve as a way to kind of \\nmonitor Indian naval activities in the Arabian Sea, and I think already causes Delhi great \\nconcern.  I suspect you'll hear more about that in the next panel. \\n Sri Lanka, no Chinese military presence there now, but, of course, given Sri \\nLanka's position kind of at the top of the Indian Ocean across the sea lines that go from kind of \\nEast Africa into the Strait of Malacca, again that would be concerning. \\n But to me, the real question ultimately is what sort of capabilities would China \\nput there?  Ultimately, if it's more capabilities that would support evacuation of its citizens or \\nHADR, those are relatively benign. \\n If it was anti-ship missiles and more offensive capability, that would raise more \\nchallenges, but at the end of the day, I mean still these would be kind of small pockets of China's \\nmilitary versus the core challenge, which is very much the Western Pacific. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Do I have time for one other question? \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Yes, sure. \\n VICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Switching gears completely, Dr. \\nKliman, you mentioned the digital development bank, and I wondered if you could talk a little bit \\nmore about what you would envision a digital development bank would be?  Would you see that \\nthere would be participation by U.S. and some of our allies' tech companies? \\n You know we're in a context right now both that we have limited money to invest \\nin things, but also American companies are under an enormous pressure from China.  We've seen \\nwhat's just happened with Marriott, Google.  They are interested in trying to get into China.  \\nWhether they would be willing to participate in an initiative that China would see as contrary to \\nthe Chinese government's interests, I'm just--I'd just like to hear a little bit more what you're \\nthinking about with the digital development bank. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Absolutely.  To be fair, it's an idea that I'm actually working to \\nflesh out now through research.  But where sort of it is right now, one, I think you could frame it \\nin a way that wasn't explicitly countering China, that the world needs digital connectivity, and so \\nwe could frame it much more as part of a positive U.S. economic engagement strategy in Asia \\nand beyond. \\n And in that sense I think make it much more of the sort of promotion that U.S. \\ndoes already to help our companies export.  So I think you wouldn't have to frame it in a way \\nthat would spook American companies from wanting to be part of it. \\n I mean you could imagine certainly foreign companies and governments wanting \\nto be part.  You'd also have potential tensions if you have U.S. companies and foreign companies \\nthat have the same sorts of products to sell.  But I mean to me it certainly--our companies do \\nhave an advantage in digital infrastructure that they don't if you're looking at building ports or \\nrailways.  It's just not something that the U.S. at this point does. \\n\\n114114\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n And so I would, it would be interesting to look at whether even a small amount of \\nmoney that Congress either could allocate new funds or from kind of existing trade promotion \\nauthorities that it might be able to kind of create something much larger.  But it's an idea that I \\nwant to work on and develop going forward. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Dr. Tobin. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\n I too was intrigued by that digital investment bank.  So thank you for responding \\nto that, but my other question for you, Dr. Kliman, was you spoke about artificial intelligence, \\nand we know from the 13th Five-Year Plan that that is an area of total commitment for the times \\ngoing forward. \\n And we know, too, both of you know, that the military sees that as a critical \\nthreat.  Could you for the record today as we think about Belt and Road talk about artificial \\nintelligence, Dr. Kliman, and how you see that affecting the military as we look at the Belt and \\nRoad Initiative, and if you would, too, Dr. Ratner, after he speaks, if you have any additional \\ncomments?   \\n Artificial intelligence.  It's a worry we know from our prior hearings. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  Absolutely.  I would not want to suggest that kind of the Belt and \\nRoad plays a, certainly a primary role in China's overall AI development strategy, which is \\nultimately domestically oriented.  It's, as you well know,-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\n DR. KLIMAN:  --to certainly catch up to and then rapidly surpass the United \\nStates.  This is a real concern if you hear kind of American tech CEOs.  They say the Chinese are \\nonly a few years behind, and they won't be behind much longer. \\n In terms of Belt and Road, to me, it's more an appendage to the AI strategy that \\nChina recently had in their kind of AI development plan. There was some language about trying \\nto build AI along the Belt and Road and cooperate with countries through new research centers. \\n There's honestly not a lot yet in the public domain on kind of the intersection of \\nAI and Belt and Road.  You can imagine going forward that I mean in terms of the larger kind of \\ndigital implications, whether it comes to like encryption standards or sort of how China's Internet \\ngovernance model, it might be a way for China to advance that. \\n In terms of the military side, I mean you well know I mean that certainly there is a \\nkind of military competition in the AI domain, and to me the main I would say asset that BRI \\nwould be for China in that sense is AI runs on data.  Data is sort of the advantage.  And so if \\nChina can essentially gain access to more and more data along Belt and Road, that gives it an \\nadvantage that along with this domestic market where they have 1.4 billion almost citizens and \\nmuch freer rules on certainly using data for the government, that it simply gives them more of a \\nresource to play in the AI space. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  It's true, and if you think about the bio \\neconomy, think about that, too, more resources that they could tap. \\n Dr. Ratner. \\n DR. RATNER:  Well, I guess I'll just say I think the good news is this is an area \\nwhere the Trump administration and the U.S. government more broadly is quite focused, as I \\nunderstand it, in the intelligence community and at the White House and the State Department \\nand otherwise.  So I think to-- \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Good. \\n DR. RATNER:  --the extent that we lack a comprehensive competitive Asia \\n\\n115115\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nstrategy and China strategy, this is an area where there is awareness and focus.  I think the \\nremedies as it relates to CFIUS reform and other defensive measures folks are taking a hard look \\nat.  It's a big bureaucratic problem.  There's questions around research and development.  \\n And then, of course, the broader issue of the fact that us taking actions alone is \\nnot going to be enough here, and we need to be working with allies and partners, who if we are \\neffective at blocking China's efforts to either steal or buy our advanced technologies to corner the \\nmarket on some of these, in some of these areas, that they don't just then go to Germany or Israel \\nor the next stop. \\n And I think we are working on that.  But again I would come back to the best \\nsolution to this is a coordinated set of rules.  There are rules around data localization in TPP, and \\nI think, again, if it's not going to be the Trans-Pacific Partnership because that's a four-letter \\nword in Washington, then we can think about rules around fairness or whatever it is, and pull the \\nchapters out of that that we can work with partners, and then, of course, connect them up to TTIP \\nand the Europeans, which was the original intention of building a high-standard global trade and \\ninvestment regime, which is quite important. \\n So I think that's where the answers lie, and I don't have the political--the political \\nquestion you asked is the really hard one.  But the good news is that the fundamental strategic \\nand economic reasons for it are really important.  So not making it up, saying it really matters. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  One of the things that at points when I'm \\ndiscouraged, I say we've done it before.  We had SEMATECH in the '80s, I guess it was.  We've \\nhad Sputnik.  You know, we've just got to--and then Senator Talent's ideas of how can we \\narticulate this better to get it moving forward. \\n Thank you. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Well, seeing no further questions, I want to thank \\nboth of our witnesses for their sharing their wonderful expertise with us today, and I'll also \\nmention that Dr. Wuthnow's written testimony should be available on the Commission website at \\nsome point in the near future.  \\n But, again, thank you both for being here, and we will reconvene at two p.m. for \\nour third and final panel. \\n [Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m., the hearing recessed, to reconvene at 2:00 p.m., this \\nsame day.] \\n \\n  \\n\\n116116\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nPANEL III INTRODUCTION BY CO-CHAIR KATHERINE C. TOBIN \\n \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  This will be the third panel that I'll \\nintroduce in a minute, but before I do, I'd like to give special thanks to the Commission staff, to \\nMichelle Ker--where are you, Michelle--from our economics team, to Caitlin Campbell and \\nJacob Stokes from our security and foreign relations team.  They worked together with \\nCommissioner Shea and me and with our witnesses during the recent months as we prepared for \\ntoday's hearing.  \\n Thank you all very much for this joint hearing that was well put together.   \\n So on our third panel, we will explore regional reactions to the Belt and Road \\nInitiative and various competing visions offered by countries such as Japan and India.  We have \\nan impressive lineup of experts to discuss these topics. \\n We'll begin with Andrew Small.  Mr. Small is a Senior Transatlantic Fellow with \\nthe Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund.  Prior to this position, Mr. Small was based in \\nthe Fund's Brussels office for five years. \\n Mr. Small will provide testimony this afternoon on South Asia's response to the \\nBelt and Road Initiative with focus on Pakistani responses to the China-Pakistan Economic \\nCorridor and how India is responding to the Belt and Road Initiative on a strategic level. \\n Next we will hear from a Commission alumnus, Joshua Eisenman.  Welcome \\nback, Joshua.  It's good to see you.  It's great to have you here today. \\n Dr. Eisenman is an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas' Lyndon Baines \\nJohnson School of Public Affairs.  He's also a Senior Fellow for China Studies at the American \\nForeign Policy Council. \\n Dr. Eisenman will testify about developing world perceptions of and responses to \\nthe Belt and Road Initiative drawing on his forthcoming book, which focuses on China's \\nstrategies in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast \\nAsia.  I understand you have various people putting forth analysis on those regions. \\n Finally, we'll hear from Mr. Tobias Harris.  Mr. Harris is the Fellow for Economy, \\nTrade and Business at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA.  He is also an analyst covering \\nJapanese politics and economics at Teneo Intelligence, which is a political risk advisory firm. \\n And in looking at your background, you have advised members, senior members \\nof the Upper House in the Diet in Japan so you have a rich base to inform us on Japan.  Thank \\nyou. \\n Mr. Harris will provide testimony on the Japanese reaction to China's far-reaching \\ninitiative and Japan's competing infrastructure initiatives throughout Asia. \\n Thank you all very much for your prepared testimony.  I'd like to remind you to \\nkeep your remarks to around seven minutes so that we'll have enough time for questions and \\nanswers. \\n So Mr. Small, let's begin with you. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Commissioner Tobin, could I just interrupt for one \\nmoment? \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yes. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  I'd just like to acknowledge another special guest \\nin the audience. Alice is here. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Oh. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Your sister. \\n\\n117117\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yes, she is. \\n CHAIRMAN CLEVELAND:  Who I met.  So I just wanted to take a minute to \\nsay welcome.  She's not been to one of our hearings before so welcome. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Well, thank you. It's a pleasure to have family \\nhere.  Thank you, Chairman. \\n Okay.  So Mr. Small. \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n118118\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF ANDREW SMALL \\nSENIOR TRANSATLANTIC FELLOW, GERMAN MARSHALL FUND OF THE \\n\\nUNITED STATES  \\n \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Thank you very much, commissioner, and thanks for the opportunity to testify to \\nthe Commission again.  Apologies also, the infamous flu bug that claimed Dr. Wuthnow also \\nclaimed the long form version of my testimony.  Sorry.  You only have the summary and my \\nphysical presence for this today. \\n I'm going to try and cover three areas: CPEC, Pakistan; India's reaction; and to a \\ncertain extent Sri Lanka.   \\n In South Asia, a lot of what we're talking about so far is political reactions to the \\nBelt and Road, still not yet considered economic assessments.  And I think that's true, even true \\nfor Pakistan, which is the most advanced set of projects that are there.   \\n There are a lot of very high dollar value sums thrown around, not all of which are \\nborn out on the ground, and I think this is partly leading people to generalize from relatively slim \\ndata, single cases that may not actually exemplify China's approach or where China itself may \\ndraw varied lessons. \\n And I think in the first place with the Belt and Road Initiative, we do also need to \\nfocus on how Beijing and recipient countries are adjusting to their experiences rather than always \\nassuming we can extrapolate. \\n The first case study for this is Pakistan, which I've testified on here before so I \\nwon't kind of reprise a lot of the basics around CPEC.  CPEC has actually gone through a \\nnumber of course corrections in the early stages.  First of all, the Chinese government left a lot of \\nthe narrative setting to the Pakistani government, and this produced a number of problems.  \\n Most of the inflated numbers come from the Pakistani side.  You saw a high level \\nof politicization of the project in the early stages, and you even saw problems for China in its \\nnegotiations with other parties who started to demand similar sized package deals for themselves. \\n The Chinese Embassy started to come out with their own numbers in the last \\nperiod of time. We've seen all of these--46 billion, 64 billion, even over 100 billion.  The \\nembassy estimates about $20 billion worth of projects completed or in motion on the ground. \\n At the beginning, the Chinese also hoped to channel almost everything through \\nthe federal government.  This did not work.  They needed the provinces on board, and they've \\nsought--after a lot of the political infighting you saw in the first year or so--to try to build a \\nbroader political consensus behind CPEC. \\n It's not complete, but I think at the political level, they're in a much stronger \\nposition than they were in the first place.  \\n China has also come under a lot of pressure in parliament and from the media to \\nrelease more information.  I think it was clearly not sustainable for a national initiative on this \\nscale to be quite so opaque.  It's not transparent yet, but it's more so than it was, and you've seen \\nthis with the release of the long-term plan, more of the terms of the contracts being fed out, and \\nso on. \\n And you've also seen in the negotiations on phase two of CPEC, China proposes \\nspecial economic zones that would only be accessible to Chinese companies.  Pakistani chambers \\nof commerce complain, and the plan is adjusted.  There is a number of other cases as well, and \\nPakistan has learned lessons too.  They negotiated a lot of these deals very quickly, some on \\nrelatively unfavorable terms in the first phase, partly because they didn't have a lot of options and \\n\\n119119\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\npartly just because they wanted to draw China in. \\n I think they've understood their own leverage somewhat better in the last year or \\nso.  They've negotiated even with existing projects some slightly better pricing levels for the \\npower projects, walked away from certain projects. \\n And I think if you're looking at analyzing success, there are a lot of issues around \\nCPEC that we can get into, but if you look at the history of the economic relationship between \\nthe two countries, where they started from and what the expectations were going into this, I think \\nthe mere fact that a lot of these projects have actually moved ahead makes it one of the only \\nearly clear semi-kind of success stories so far. \\n The second case is Sri Lanka.  And Sri Lanka, of course, was already described as \\na kind of debt trap poster child.  Hambantota, white elephant.  But you also have in Sri Lanka, as \\nhas also been mentioned, Colombo, where China helped to increase the port capacity, and the \\noverwhelming majority of the transit trade actually goes to India.  As a result, you see some of \\nthe road developments there. \\n Now both of these cases are portrayed as sort of successes.  The whole Sri Lanka \\ncase is a sort of heads-I-win/tails-you-lose case.  Debt traps mean that China gets the rights on \\nthe port. On the other hand, there are some clear projects that have been success stories there. \\n I would still question whether China fully assesses it in this way.  Yes, they have \\nthe long-term lease on the port, 70 percent control, but a Sri Lankan state-controlled company \\ncontrols access to and security for Hambantota port, and there appear to have been guarantees \\npretty much given to India that the PLA Navy will not have the opportunity to use that.  \\n You've seen the port calls in Colombo, the sort that took place with submarines \\nbefore were denied by the new government, and I mean, in fact, the fall of the Rajapaksa \\ngovernment was partly as a result of the port calls that those submarines paid.  India then swung \\nin to help pull the political opposition together as a result. \\n Now in many ways this is a case that looks not just like an embarrassing case, \\nwhich has been able to be highlighted as a problem for China but also a cautionary tale for others \\nin how close a security relationship might get and what the repercussions even for governments \\nmight be. \\n The third and final case is India's reaction.  The interesting contrast for the Indian \\ncase is Russia.  China worked very hard politically to get Moscow's acquiescence to the Silk \\nRoad Economic Belt and the Eurasian Union merger, and it's even, as I think we'll hear, managed \\nto reach some sort of terms with Japan. \\n It really didn't put those political efforts in with India in the first phase.  They \\nwere bounced into a plan that they had made as they were shaping as CPEC was moved under \\nthe auspices of the BRI, and to India's surprise, and I think China is now seeing some of the \\nrepercussions in the region to that, not just the fact that it's the only major country not to send \\nsignificant representation to the Belt and Road Forum, but you've seen efforts on India's part \\nreally to be the most, the significant country that's actually pushing back against Chinese efforts. \\n Now India is very well aware of its limitations, and these aren't just the financing \\navailable to the Indian side.  It's also, of course, India has a lot of infrastructure development to \\ndo at home.  China has the luxury of being able to do this after a lot of the domestic efforts it's \\nalso pursued, which effectively it's externalizing. \\n On the economic side, nonetheless, there are things India can do.  You've seen \\nthat with Hambantota airport, you've seen it with Chabahar, you've seen major power projects in \\nBangladesh, but India has recognized that operating alone is not enough. \\n\\n120120\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\n They turned to Japan for the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor.  But India has also \\nbeen aware that political influence matters too.  India has effectively imposed certain red lines on \\nthe Belt and Road Initiative in South Asia.  I mentioned the Sri Lankan case.  I think you've seen \\nsimilar red lines laid down with the Maldives and with Bangladesh.  There are areas where India \\nsays there are things that we are not comfortable with.  This isn't just an economic choice. \\n And Bangladesh, I think, is the other interesting case in that respect where you \\nsaw after concerns partly that followed what played out in Sri Lanka.  Sri Lanka--Bangladesh \\nbuying Chinese submarines has a very substantial arms relationship.  India swung in when it \\ncame to the deepwater port with a degree of political pressure, but then it was Japanese money.  \\nIn the end, I think the largest dollar, yen loan that JICA has ever made to secure the deepwater \\nport in Bangladesh. \\n So you saw the kind of combination of money plus some political muscle, I think, \\nin that case.   \\n I'm over time.  I have a couple of points on the U.S. response that I can add if \\npeople are interested in hearing.  Otherwise, I might can cede. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Go for it now. \\n MR. SMALL:  Okay.  Thank you. \\n HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Please. \\n MR. SMALL:  So, finally, then on the U.S. response, the other speakers this \\nmorning, who I listened to, have laid out a lot of this, and I think it's in the summary as well.  \\nThe competitive piece of this relationship, clearly it's partly about providing options for \\ngovernments and partly about providing information to civil society, members of parliament, \\njournalists, to enable them to better scrutinize what's going on, and I fully agree that that's the \\nthrust of what we should be doing. \\n But I think even with that, we have to be realistic.  Even with good options, a \\nnumber of these countries have reasons to take Chinese money anyway.  Sometimes it's cheaper.  \\nSometimes it's targeted to political needs.  Sometimes they don't want to adhere to high \\nstandards.  And sometimes it gives these countries leverage against other traditionally dominant \\npowers in their own region. \\n In South Asia, that's India.  In Central Asia, that's Russia.  In Europe, it can even \\nmean the EU or Germany if you look at cases like Greece and Hungary that were mentioned \\nearlier today.  The EU money that has gone into some of these countries vastly dwarfs anything \\nthat the Chinese have put in or are putting in now. \\n Nonetheless, these countries still see certain advantages in taking Chinese \\nresources, and I think we have to be conscious of that.  I think the important thing is that \\ncountries, and particularly some of these developing countries, are resilient, that they're not \\ncoerced, they have good options, and that they understand the repercussions of their choices.  But \\nwe will have to deal with the fact that greater Chinese presence is going to be a fact rather than \\nexpecting that we're always going to be able to counter it even with prodigious resources \\navailable. \\n Finally, I mean there are cases where it clearly serves U.S. interests.  I think \\nSenator Talent drew out the difference earlier on between the continental and the maritime zone.  \\nAnd Ely Ratner mentioned this too.  I think in continental South Asia, there are investments in \\nAfghanistan and in Pakistan that will be constructive. \\n The U.S. has urged China to support certain power projects in Pakistan for years.  \\nJust because it's called something else now doesn't necessarily mean that it's not constructive \\n\\n121121\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nBack to Table of Contents \\n\\nanymore. \\n And there are even instances where it is possible to work with the Chinese on \\nsome of these projects.  U.S. companies like GE are doing so.  I think there's been some quiet \\ncooperation there in some of these very select cases where it's clearly consistent with U.S. \\ninterests. \\n The very, very final point.  South Asia has a problem in that it's a region where \\nsecurity has often trumped economics.  It's very poorly integrated.  There's a tiny proportion of \\ninvestment in the region, barely one percent inter-regional by comparison with investors from \\noutside the region, a very small portion of inter-regional trade.  The U.S. has put efforts into this \\nfor some time, whether it's diplomatic efforts on transit trade and so on. \\n We do need to be careful that some of these competitive connectivity efforts in \\nthe region don't reinforce this, don't turn into a further extension of military rivalry, or produce \\nwastefulness that just adds to the problem. \\n Dealing with the rise of China is clearly an important priority in South Asia, but \\nit's certainly not the only one. \\n Thanks. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n122122\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Belt and Road Initiative in South Asia  \\n\\nJanuary 26th, 2017 \\n\\nAndrew Small, Senior Transatlantic Fellow \\n\\n The German Marshall Fund of the United States \\n\\nTestimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \\n\\nHearing: China\\u2019s Belt and Road initiative: Five Years Later \\n\\nRegional Reactions and Competing Visions: South Asia \\n\\n \\n\\nSouth Asia has been one of the most important focal points for the Belt and Road \\n\\nInitiative (BRI), with two of the initiatives\\u2019 \\u201ccorridors\\u201d proposed there by China even \\n\\nbefore the broader scheme took shape. Yet their contrasting fates illustrate the \\n\\nchallenges facing the BRI in the region. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nhas become the initiative\\u2019s \\u201cflagship\\u201d, with over $20 billion of projects already in motion \\n\\nand a rebalancing of national economic strategy to take advantage of the flows of \\n\\nChinese financing. The Bangladesh China India Myanmar corridor (BCIM) has stalled and \\n\\nIndia has emerged as an open opponent of the initiative, the single major country not to \\n\\nhave significant representation at the Belt and Road Forum in May 2017 despite intense \\n\\nChinese lobbying.  \\n\\n \\n\\nFive years on, the public debate about the BRI in South Asia is still shaped more by \\n\\npolitics than economics. This is partly because there remains more speculative \\n\\nextrapolation from individual cases than hard economic data. Even in the case of the \\n\\nmost advanced part of the entire scheme, CPEC, there is not yet a settled verdict on the \\n\\nnet financial, growth, or employment implications of the projects. Much of the \\n\\ndiscussion in the region is still absorbed with security analysis \\u2013 dual-use facilities, \\n\\ncompeting routes, economic coercion, terrorist threats to projects, and sovereignty \\n\\nconcerns. And the initiative has taken on a polarizing quality. Opponents portray a \\n\\nscheme that is set up to entrap countries, essentially military-strategic in nature, and \\n\\ndoomed to fail. Boosters claim it will have a \\u201cgame-changing\\u201d economic impact, help to \\n\\nimprove security ties between neighbors, and promote stability and de-radicalization. \\n\\nThe provisional state of the scheme has allowed for the projection of fears and fantasies \\n\\nin equal measure.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMost governments in the region have mixed views. On the one hand, they want to \\n\\nbenefit from the potential influx of Chinese investment, draw on quickly-available \\n\\nfinancing that circumvents the need for detailed IFI review processes, and take \\n\\nadvantage of China\\u2019s growing role to gain leverage in their dealings with the \\n\\ntraditionally dominant power in the region, India. The connectivity deficit in South Asia \\n\\nis significant: the World Bank estimates that intra-regional trade accounts for only 5% of \\n\\nthe total, compared to 25% in South East Asia, 35% in East Asia and 60% in Europe, \\n\\n\\n\\nwhile intra-regional investment is below 1% of the overall sum. Although some of the \\n\\nChinese projects are rightly portrayed as white elephants, others fill genuine needs in \\n\\nupgrading the capacity of ports, addressing inadequacies in energy supplies, and \\n\\nimproving road and rail infrastructure. Yet at the same time, states in the region have \\n\\nconcerns about the security implications of a deeper Chinese economic presence, the \\n\\npotential influx of Chinese workers and companies, the quality of the projects, the terms \\n\\nof the contracts, and ensuring that closer economic ties with China do not come at the \\n\\nexpense of relations with India, the United States, and other partners.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe United States and the BRI in South Asia \\n\\n \\n\\nFor the United States, the BRI provides some obvious grounds for concern. Given \\n\\nChina\\u2019s existing track record, it would be prudent to find ways to limit Beijing\\u2019s capacity \\n\\nto translate economic influence in the Indian Ocean into political and security outcomes \\n\\nthat are inimical to the interests of the United States, and its friends and allies. \\n\\nCoordination with like-minded partners, particularly India, Japan, Australia, and the \\n\\nEuropeans, can help provide alternative economic options for states, minimize the risk \\n\\nof their dependence on China, strengthen their hand in negotiations with Beijing, give \\n\\nthem the information and intelligence they need to navigate the risks involved, and \\n\\nensure that journalists and civil society have the capacity to scrutinize deals and projects \\n\\neffectively. While building resilience and reducing the scope for Chinese coercion are \\n\\nlikely to be the main goals, in select instances where security sensitivities are high, \\n\\ntargeted political pressure, economic incentives and cooperation between partners can \\n\\nbe deployed to deter countries from agreeing certain Chinese investments altogether, as \\n\\nBangladesh\\u2019s decision over its deep-water port in 2015 illustrates.  \\n\\n \\n\\nAlthough international and regional support for South Asia\\u2019s economic integration long \\n\\npredates the BRI, the launch of the initiative has had a helpful galvanizing effect, forcing \\n\\na self-critical look on the part of many countries at the scope and effectiveness of their \\n\\nown efforts. As the U.S. \\u201cFree and Open Indo-Pacific\\u201d strategy moves into \\n\\nimplementation, Japan and India have taken important early steps in improving their \\n\\noffer, with the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure, the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, \\n\\nadditional ADB financing, and a number of other smaller schemes, while the EU will \\n\\nlaunch its own Euro-Asia connectivity strategy in the coming months. At least as \\n\\nimportant, though, is the broader framework of trade and investment cooperation. \\n\\nBilateral free-trade and investment agreements, and plurilateral agreements such as the \\n\\nTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), will do even more to define the rules and structures of \\n\\neconomic relations than hard infrastructure investments. Many of these efforts were \\n\\nspecifically conceived as a way to build a standard-setting framework beyond the WTO \\n\\nthat addresses many China-related concerns, from IPR protection to the role of state-\\n\\n\\n\\nowned enterprises. Japan, the EU, Canada, Australia, and several states in southeast Asia \\n\\nhave continued their attempts to stitch together a new set of complementary trade \\n\\nplatforms stretching from Europe to the Asia Pacific. South Asia was already \\n\\nconspicuous by its absence from these processes, and the drawing back of the United \\n\\nStates from its leadership role in global trade makes it even harder to push forward an \\n\\neconomic agenda in the region that serves these broader goals. Even in the optimal \\n\\ncircumstances, states in South Asia will, in many cases, still choose Chinese financing \\n\\nprecisely because it is non-transparent, provides opportunities for corruption, is highly-\\n\\nattuned to to the political needs of the government in power, and allows states greater \\n\\nautonomy in their dealings with India and the West. But at present, the United States \\n\\nand its allies are operating in the region with fewer resources in a competition that is \\n\\nbeing played on Beijing\\u2019s terms, rather than fully leveraging their strengths.  \\n\\n \\n\\nNonetheless, U.S. and Chinese interests are not purely competitive. While China\\u2019s \\n\\nincreasing role in South Asia is an important strategic development to address, the \\n\\nUnited States and its partners have other important equities in the region too, from \\n\\nterrorism and conflict risks to the commercial opportunities presented by the world\\u2019s \\n\\nfastest growing region. Some aspects of the BRI will undermine this agenda, but others \\n\\ncan help to support it. There are countries - particularly in continental South Asia - \\n\\nwhere Chinese investments have clear potential to bolster U.S. security goals. In \\n\\nAfghanistan and Pakistan, the United States has for many years encouraged China to \\n\\nplay a greater economic role for the sake of stability in both countries, whether helping \\n\\nto provide a sustainable revenue base for the Afghan government or addressing the \\n\\nenergy crisis in Pakistan. This logic behind this has not changed. In these cases, U.S.-\\n\\nChina coordination can play a constructive role in ensuring that projects are well-\\n\\nattuned to these states\\u2019 economic and political needs, drawing on the lessons of the \\n\\ndeep U.S. economic, financial and development role there over decades. There is also a \\n\\nU.S. interest in ensuring that trade and economics do not fuse with geopolitical \\n\\ncompetition in destabilizing or wasteful fashion. Given the scale of the infrastructure \\n\\nneeds of the region, it should be possible for supposedly competitive schemes to have a \\n\\ncomplementary impact. But redundant rather than mutually reinforcing infrastructure \\n\\ndevelopment efforts would increase the risk of financially unviable projects and bad \\n\\ndebts. Even more importantly, while in East Asia, rivals have been able to sustain \\n\\nmutually beneficial economic relationships, in South Asia, trade and investment linkages \\n\\nhave long been stymied by security rifts. The longstanding U.S. interest in mitigating this \\n\\nproblem rather than allowing the economics of the region to turn into an extension of \\n\\nmilitary rivalry has not changed either. This makes easy generalizations difficult: any \\n\\nassessment of how the United States should respond to the BRI in South Asia has to be \\n\\nbased on a close country-by-country - and even project-by-project - analysis of the role \\n\\nthat new Chinese investments and financing will play in the regional economic and \\n\\n\\n\\nsecurity order.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe BRI in South Asia: an overview \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen evaluating BRI investments in South Asia, it is helpful to distinguish between \\n\\nprojects that were specifically envisaged under the scheme and those that predate it. \\n\\nThere are a number of differences in the economic model that informed the previous \\n\\nChinese approach to investment, the level of diligence applied by Chinese financing \\n\\ninstitutions, the decision-making processes on the Chinese side, the strategic intentions \\n\\nbehind the investments, and the political salience attached to them. While there will \\n\\nevidently be many elements of continuity in the behavior of Chinese actors, the push for \\n\\nnatural resources in the 2000s that lay behind the Saindak and Aynak copper mines, say, \\n\\nis not the same as the present infrastructure-heavy approach. Equally, some seemingly-\\n\\nfailed investments from a previous era, such as Gwadar and Hambantota ports, have \\n\\nreceived a new lease on life under BRI auspices and merit re-appraisal. It is also helpful \\n\\nto base assessments on projects that are actually in the process of implementation \\n\\nrather than those that are still under negotiation, and may never see the light of day. \\n\\nSome estimates of the CPEC package now run at well over $100 billion, yet Chinese \\n\\nofficials themselves use a substantially more conservative metric, and the last few years \\n\\nhave seen a number of major investments shelved, from Diamer Bhasha dam to several \\n\\ncoal-fired power plants.  \\n\\n \\n\\nOn this basis, a brief overview runs as follows. Despite a very disappointing history of \\n\\neconomic relations between the two countries, Pakistan has attracted by far the largest \\n\\npackage of investments. Incorporating energy projects, rail and road connections, \\n\\ninfrastructure development, and industrial zones, CPEC is one of the few schemes that \\n\\nappears to match the ambitions of the overall initiative. It is also buttressed by further \\n\\nenergy projects that do not technically fall under CPEC\\u2019s ambit. After a rocky start, in \\n\\nwhich Beijing was surprised by the level of political infighting and protest in a country \\n\\nthat has been its most reliable security partner, China has secured a level of consensus \\n\\nbehind CPEC from Pakistani political elites and has succeeded in moving ahead with \\n\\nmany of the first phase of projects, which are already showing tangible results in the \\n\\npower sector, roads, and the development of Gwadar. Nonetheless, there are still \\n\\nsignificant unresolved questions and internal debates over the impact of CPEC on \\n\\nPakistan\\u2019s growth rate and finances, as well as its overall strategic direction - reviving the \\n\\nold question of whether Chinese backing plays an emboldening or restraining role on \\n\\nthe country in its regional behavior. Afghanistan, by contrast, has elicited very little \\n\\nChinese interest, with the major pre-existing oil and copper investments there in stasis. \\n\\nWhile there are tentative discussions about the development of new cross-border \\n\\ninfrastructure with Pakistan and rail links through Central Asia, progress is slow and it \\n\\n\\n\\nwill likely not improve markedly until there is a major change in the security situation. \\n\\nBangladesh has agreed a package of investments that amount to a high dollar figure \\n\\n($28 billion) but developments on the ground have been more limited, governed by a \\n\\nlevel of political caution that reflects the close relationship between the Hasina \\n\\ngovernment and New Delhi. China lost out on the opportunity to develop the country\\u2019s \\n\\nfirst deepwater port after political pressure from India and the United States, and an \\n\\nattractive financial offer from Tokyo - whose development agency, JICA, issued its \\n\\nlargest-ever loan - saw a Japanese alternative selected instead. Sri Lanka had a \\n\\nsignificant package of Chinese investments dating from the Rajapaksa era, surging in \\n\\nthe immediate aftermath of the civil war, during which China had provided crucial \\n\\ndiplomatic backing and arms supplies. This included a set of projects in and around the \\n\\ncapital, Colombo, that were largely economically sound - including the expansion of \\n\\nColombo port and the Southern Expressway - and a set of white elephant projects in the \\n\\nsouth of the country around Rajapaksa\\u2019s home constituency. These added to the \\n\\ncountry\\u2019s severe debt burden and, following Sirisena\\u2019s election in 2015, the new \\n\\ngovernment was forced to renegotiate terms with the Chinese, resulting in Chinese \\n\\ncompanies taking a 70% share in Hambantota port on a 99-year lease. While it is fair to \\n\\nsay that Sri Lanka\\u2019s debt problems are more a byproduct of the civil war than a Chinese \\n\\n\\u201cdebt trap\\u201d ploy, and that the more egregious projects there predate the BRI, the \\n\\npunitive and restrictive terms of the contracts and the subsequent debt-for-equity deal \\n\\nwere undoubtedly Beijing\\u2019s own doing, and have turned the Sri Lankan case into \\n\\nprobably the most damning critique of the BRI. The Maldives is now heading into similar \\n\\nterritory: on some estimates, over 70% of the government\\u2019s foreign debt is owed to \\n\\nChina, which has taken on projects at prices that are widely seen to be inflated, made \\n\\nland purchases that required a constitutional amendment, initiated a free-trade \\n\\nagreement with minimal scrutiny, and provided political and economic support to an \\n\\nincreasingly autocratic government. The democratic opposition has even threatened to \\n\\nbring a case to the Hague against Chinese \\u201cland grabs\\u201d if it takes office. In Nepal, \\n\\nconversely, the recent change of government has brought to office a left alliance that \\n\\nhas promised to push ahead with Chinese projects - including a dam and rail link - that \\n\\nits predecessor had stalled, despite formally signing up to the scheme.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIf the first phase of the BRI in South Asia still has relatively little economic data to \\n\\nanalyze, the political impact has been considerable, particularly when it comes to China\\u2019s \\n\\ndealings with the largest two countries in the region: India and Pakistan. \\n\\n  \\n\\nCase study: CPEC, a relative success \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen CPEC was launched during Xi Jinping\\u2019s visit in April 2015, the disappointing track \\n\\nrecord of economic cooperation between the two countries gave cause for deep \\n\\n\\n\\nskepticism about how much of the proposed investment would actually materialize. \\n\\nBetween 2001 and 2011, while $66 billion of Chinese investments in Pakistan had been \\n\\ncumulatively announced, only 6% of these were ever realized. By this metric alone, CPEC \\n\\nhas been a success. While the larger numbers thrown around are often inflated, from the \\n\\ninitial $46 billion to triple-digit estimates, even the more conservative figures provided \\n\\nby the Chinese embassy in Islamabad suggest that over $20 billion is now in motion on \\n\\nthe ground.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPolitical reactions in Pakistan have gone through three cycles.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe first was an optimistic public face from the government but private doubts that the \\n\\ninitiative could be realized, after many years of a bleak investment climate and the \\n\\nconsistently poor historical experience with Chinese economic cooperation. The \\n\\nPakistani side rapidly agreed terms for many of the initial contracts that were not \\n\\nespecially favorable and the cumulative financial impact was not very seriously assessed, \\n\\npartly on the assumption that only a fraction of the projects would actually happen. But \\n\\nit had the effect of drawing China in and ensuring that a large-dollar value could be \\n\\nattached to Xi Jinping\\u2019s visit: $28 billion of projects agreed, $46 billion when projects \\n\\nthat were still under negotiation were included. This gave the scheme higher political \\n\\nsalience during a phase when Beijing was struggling to find opportunities to move the \\n\\nBRI forward tangibly on the ground. China did not initially expect that CPEC would be \\n\\nthe \\u201cflagship\\u201d for the BRI but Pakistan was one of the few countries that was \\n\\ncomfortable with offering such a wide array of projects on financially-attractive terms \\n\\nand allowing a such a privileged role for Chinese companies in the process.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe second cycle was characterized by internal disputes over the beneficiaries of CPEC, \\n\\nonce it became clear that there were real resources attached to it. This was partly born \\n\\nout of confusion about what the scheme actually amounted to, a confusion that still \\n\\naffects understanding of the corridor. CPEC was initially understood to be a transit route \\n\\nfor goods and energy to flow between Xinjiang and Gwadar port, resulting in fierce \\n\\nbattles over where the supposedly lucrtic route would go. Yet Beijing has long been \\n\\nskeptical of Pakistan\\u2019s value as a transit corridor. The land route between the two \\n\\ncountries is routinely closed by landslides and was virtually impassable for several years. \\n\\nThe cost of transporting energy via pipelines or other means is also prohibitively \\n\\nexpensive. From a military perspective, the route is extremely vulnerable in the event of \\n\\na major conflict. While there are security concerns about Balochistan and other locations \\n\\non the route, topography is by far the greater challenge. Before CPEC, China was already \\n\\nworking with Pakistan to upgrade the Karakoram Highway to a wider, all-weather \\n\\nsurface, including tunneling to reduce the vulnerability of some of the most landslide-\\n\\nprone sections of the route. But the continued expectation is that, while land trade will \\n\\n\\n\\nrise from its existing low base, the most reliable and economically efficient trade route \\n\\nbetween the two sides will still be by sea. This is evident from any assessment of the \\n\\nplans for current and future CPEC projects through 2030, where the cross-border \\n\\nconnectivity elements are modest, with no railways or pipelines currently envisaged. The \\n\\nplans instead include a diffuse array of Chinese investments across Pakistan, heavily \\n\\nfocused on energy projects and improvements in internal infrastructure connections. If \\n\\nthese elements are successful, China and Pakistan intend to move forward with broader-\\n\\nbased industrial cooperation through special economic zones and other ventures, \\n\\nbefore ultimately moving into other areas that include agriculture and tourism. Although \\n\\nthe term \\u201ccorridor\\u201d is evocative, CPEC is more accurately described as an investment \\n\\npackage and an economic cooperation platform. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe third cycle has seen a more realistic appraisal of some of the economic risks - \\n\\nparticularly with respect to debt and balance of payments - and willingness on the \\n\\nPakistani side to negotiate harder on terms as a result. Implementation has also moved \\n\\nout from the federal level to the provinces, while the federal government has focused on \\n\\nnegotiations over the long-term plan and CPEC\\u2019s second phase. Meanwhile, many of the \\n\\nearly harvest projects are in advanced stages of completion: notably some of the power \\n\\nprojects and roads. This includes the first road connection of Gwadar through \\n\\nBalochistan to the Pakistani interior rather than along the coastal highway to Karachi. \\n\\nWith phase two of CPEC about to get underway, we are likely entering into another \\n\\ndistinct phase of reactions. Where phase one was heavily focused on road and energy \\n\\nprojects, phase two is focused on industrial cooperation and special economic zones. In \\n\\npractice, China had been able to build roads, ports and power plants in the past but \\n\\nprivate sector cooperation and the Pakistani export sector have always been more of a \\n\\nchallenge. There are already tensions with Pakistani industry, which does not want to see \\n\\nChinese companies operating under the sorts of incentivized conditions that China itself \\n\\nused to draw Western companies to locate in special economic zones in the 1980s and \\n\\n1990s.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIn theory, the coming years should see some demonstrable CPEC success stories \\u2013 \\n\\npower stations coming online, the establishment of industrial zones that should \\n\\ngenerate more (and higher quality) jobs than the early harvest projects, and even a \\n\\nGwadar that can start to function as a viable port. But the risks of failure and of local \\n\\nunhappiness are significant, whether it be regions seeing an influx of Chinese workers or \\n\\nfurther incidents that see Chinese citizens being killed and kidnapped. All of this is \\n\\ncompounded by the fact that the next period also sees the greatest projected risks of \\n\\ndebt and balance of payment crises across CPEC\\u2019s lifetime. The first of these may come \\n\\nas early as this year, if Pakistan returns to the IMF, which would have the effect of \\n\\nmaking it appear, accurately or otherwise, that the international community is bailing \\n\\n\\n\\nout Chinese economic investments. It is also far from clear that CPEC can really fulfill the \\n\\ninflated expectations that have become attached to it - catalyzing a growth take-off, let \\n\\nalone the ambitious Chinese political and security goals detailed during my testimony \\n\\non China and Pakistan in the 2016 hearing. \\n\\n \\n\\nNonetheless, even if the jury is still out over the longer-term, CPEC can already be \\n\\nconsidered to be a partial success for the BRI given the challenging circumstances, poor \\n\\nhistorical track record, and commensurately low expectations. Relatively high levels of \\n\\npolitical trust between the two governments, a degree of consensus behind CPEC across \\n\\nthe Pakistani political spectrum and its civilian and military institutions, and alignment \\n\\nbetween Chinese and Pakistani strategic goals, have created the conditions for a very \\n\\nwide array of projects to move forward despite the clear obstacles. The nature of the \\n\\nSino-Pakistani relationship may make it a sui generis case but since it is the most \\n\\nadvanced package of economic cooperation that exists under the BRI, it will be used as \\n\\na reference point for the scheme nonetheless.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIn this sense, there is also the potential for developments with CPEC to counteract other \\n\\nelements of the emerging BRI narrative. The view that Pakistan will find itself in a similar \\n\\nposition to say, Sri Lanka, in which China can make political demands, gain land \\n\\nconcessions, and generally exploit Pakistan\\u2019s position of growing dependence to pursue \\n\\nmilitary and political ends is wide of the mark. While this might be a plausible argument \\n\\nfor China\\u2019s dealings with certain other developing countries, it is at odds with the \\n\\ndynamics of the Sino-Pakistani relationship. Pakistan is already highly accommodating \\n\\nto Chinese preferences. It has been more than open to Beijing\\u2019s requests for everything \\n\\nfrom use of military facilities to access for Chinese companies. And on the rare occasions \\n\\nwhen Beijing does choose to exercise its leverage more forcefully, it has been able to do \\n\\nso. If anything, creating a more coercive set of conditions would risk weakening China\\u2019s \\n\\nhand. Its leverage rests on a hard-earned reputation as the country that is most reliably \\n\\naligned with Pakistan\\u2019s long-term security interests, and the resulting high levels of trust \\n\\namong both elites and the public. CPEC has already proved more controversial in \\n\\nPakistan than China would have liked, and there is little appetite for measures that \\n\\nwould foster resentment in a relationship that Chinese leaders wish to portray as a \\n\\n\\u201cmodel to follow.\\u201d While there are good grounds to believe that CPEC will run into \\n\\nchallenges, Pakistan is a case where China is more likely to exhibit strategic generosity \\n\\nthan squeezing one of its only friends. \\n\\n \\n\\nCase study: India, a political mishandling  \\n\\n \\n\\nOne of China\\u2019s chief political concerns in the early days of the BRI was to secure Russian \\n\\nconsent and approval for the Silk Road Economic Belt. A premium was placed not just \\n\\n\\n\\non ensuring bilateral cooperation for investments in Russia itself but the coordination of \\n\\nplans between the SREB and Russia\\u2019s Eurasian Union and with it, a blessing for the \\n\\nfurther expansion of China\\u2019s investments in countries that Russia considers to sit within \\n\\nits sphere of influence. In South Asia, China would have been well advised to make a \\n\\nsimilarly comprehensive effort with India. The relationships between the two countries \\n\\nare evidently qualitatively different, and Moscow\\u2019s back was against the wall as a result \\n\\nof the sanctions regime imposed after its annexation of Crimea, but the principle - that a \\n\\nserious attempt should be made to reach a political accord with potentially disruptive \\n\\ncountries during the inception phase of the BRI - was not observed and has proved \\n\\ncostly for China.  \\n\\n \\n\\nDespite its doubts, India had agreed in 2013 to move tentatively forward with plans for \\n\\nthe BCIM corridor. It had joined the Chinese-initiated Asia Infrastructure Investment \\n\\nBank (AIIB). The Modi government had also shown interest in relaxing the rules that had \\n\\nrestricted Chinese investment in India in the past. In this sense, New Delhi was not \\n\\napproaching the BRI from a position of deep pre-existing hostility. Yet in the early \\n\\nstages, India was surprised to see a number of its ports feature on semi-official maps of \\n\\nthe BRI, for China to place the BCIM corridor under the BRI\\u2019s auspices - in neither case \\n\\nwith any consultations - which was then rendered even more problematic by Beijing\\u2019s \\n\\ndecision to include CPEC under the BRI rather than as a separate and distinct initiative.  \\n\\n \\n\\nCPEC has provided the main focus of the formal objections that India raised with China \\n\\nover the BRI, since it transits territory that India disputes, and that China has long \\n\\nacknowledged is disputed. But in reality the cross-border transit elements of the scheme \\n\\nare relatively minor, the package of investments in Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir proper is \\n\\nsmall, and other countries - including the United States - have supported development \\n\\nprojects in these territories without similar Indian objections. It is hard to make the case \\n\\nthat there is a significant material change to the status quo, that CPEC is a violation of a \\n\\npre-existing understanding, or that there is a consistent and principled objection to all \\n\\neconomic development efforts in Kashmir. In this sense, CPEC is better understood as \\n\\nderivative of broader Indian concerns about the deepening Sino-Pakistani relationship, \\n\\nthe security implications of China\\u2019s economic influence in its neighborhood, and \\n\\ntensions on other issues between the two sides, from India\\u2019s membership of the Nuclear \\n\\nSuppliers Group to worsening flare-ups at the border.   \\n\\n \\n\\nThe strength of Indian antipathy to the BRI was manifest in its decision - despite \\n\\nconsiderable Chinese lobbying - to be the only major country not to send a serious \\n\\ndelegation to the Belt and Road Forum in May 2017. India\\u2019s statement on the eve of the \\n\\nforum summarized its concerns, from the \\u201cfinancial responsibility to avoid projects that \\n\\nwould create unsustainable debt burden for communities\\u201d to demands that projects \\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cmust be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity\\u201d.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIndia\\u2019s response has taken three forms.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe first has been heightened attention to diplomatic and economic outreach in its \\n\\nneighborhood. Modi has paid visits to virtually every South Asian state since taking \\n\\noffice and made a renewed push for various forms of bilateral and minilateral economic \\n\\ncooperation, as well as additional investment in structures such as BIMSTEC. While India \\n\\nfaces various constraints of its own, from its lack of financial firepower to pressing \\n\\ninfrastructure demands at home, it has sought to work in conjunction with deeper-\\n\\npocketed partners, principally Japan, to expand beyond its bilateral agenda.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe second element has been the establishment - and enforcement - of some clear red \\n\\nlines regarding Chinese military presence. In 2014, Chinese submarines paid surprise \\n\\nport calls in Colombo. Sri Lanka and India had an agreement that the Indian side would \\n\\nreceive prior notification of any such visits, and the failure to do so on the part of the \\n\\nRajapaksa government appeared to portend a Sino-Sri Lankan security relationship that \\n\\nwas moving in a problematic direction. These were a catalyst for Indian efforts to bolster \\n\\nand unify Rajapaksa\\u2019s opponents, and his subsequent fate in the 2015 elections acted as \\n\\na warning to others, notably the Maldives and Bangladesh. The combination of carrot \\n\\nand stick was most strikingly in evidence for the Bangladeshi Matarbari port deal in \\n\\n2015, where political pressure and economic incentives pushed Dhaka to opt for a \\n\\nJapanese package instead of the Chinese deal that was in advanced negotiations.   \\n\\n \\n\\nThe third element has been the effort to shape the narrative around the BRI, both \\n\\nthrough public communication and private interaction with other governments, where \\n\\nIndia has been the only country to raise its concerns quite as consistently at the very \\n\\nhighest political levels. This has had a telling effect: while many countries had objections \\n\\nof their own, India has been effective at nudging them closer to their view, including \\n\\nmost notably the United States.   \\n\\n \\n\\nFor both India and China, the question is where to go next. India has been successful in \\n\\nimposing practical and reputational constraints on the BRI in South Asia but now faces a \\n\\nprotracted contest in its own region rather than having the scope to negotiate a set of \\n\\nterms with China under which BRI projects are conceived with better fit for India\\u2019s own \\n\\neconomic needs. Beijing still has the means to continue to secure projects and advance \\n\\nits economic cooperation with many South Asian governments but in a confrontational \\n\\nand politicized environment that is doing damage to the broader perception of the BRI. \\n\\nAlthough competition between China and India will certainly continue, the question in \\n\\nthe coming year will be whether the two sides are able to reach a new modus vivendi \\n\\n\\n\\nover the way it is conducted, where India is able to condition and leverage the BRI in \\n\\nSouth Asia in return for a degree of political acquiescence to the scheme. \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n \\n\\nIn 2018, the BRI is at something of a crossroads in South Asia. One of the biggest \\n\\nquestions in the coming years will be whether China learns from its early experiences \\n\\nand adjusts as a result or if some of the early problems become endemic. There are \\n\\nseveral areas in which course corrections on China\\u2019s part would change not only how \\n\\nthe initiative is perceived but also its likely impact on the region. These include: the \\n\\nclosed nature of aspects of the scheme to third countries; its bilateral rather than \\n\\nregionally-focused character; its lack of transparency; the concerning approach to the \\n\\nhandling of debt issues; and China\\u2019s failure, so far, to reach an accommodation with \\n\\nIndia over strategic economic issues in the region. Some analysis holds that this is \\n\\nsimply a function of the way Beijing operates, and that these issues are - as a result - \\n\\nhardwired into the BRI. That may prove to be accurate. Yet the controversies around the \\n\\nearly days of the initiative are a sharp contrast with the successful Chinese diplomacy \\n\\nthat characterized the inception stages of the AIIB. Despite similar levels of international \\n\\nskepticism, China showed political deftness there in getting so many countries on board \\n\\n- including India - as well as demonstrating willingness to pursue infrastructure \\n\\ninitiatives that appear to adhere to international standards and complement existing \\n\\nconnectivity efforts. It would be unrealistic to expect China to turn the entirety of the BRI \\n\\ninto an enlarged version of the AIIB: the opportunity to provide bilateral, politically \\n\\ndirected investments is a prerogative that Beijing shows little inclination to forego. But \\n\\nwith the BRI emerging from its teething phase, China faces a choice: to develop the \\n\\ninitiative in the direction of a closed, Sino-centric \\u201chub-and-spokes\\u201d model, which is \\n\\nliable to exacerbate geopolitical competition in the region and provoke further \\n\\nresistance from other powers, or something closer to an open \\u201cplatform\\u201d model, which - \\n\\nwhile still serving many of China\\u2019s bilateral interests - would also be more closely \\n\\nattuned to South Asia\\u2019s considerable needs for economic integration.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF JOSHUA EISENMAN \\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT \\n\\nAUSTIN  \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\nDr. Eisenman, please. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be back here at \\n\\nthe Commission, and I want to thank the Commission staffers, Michelle, Caitlin, my old friend \\nNargiza, and of course Commissioner Bartholomew, it's great to see you again.  And if I might \\njust recognize one person in the audience, Commissioner Pat Mulloy, my friend and mentor, \\nwho's joined us here today. \\n\\nSo where to jump in on this.  Oh, very briefly, of course, OBOR is loan driven.  \\nAll right.  OBOR, BRI, whatever we call it, it's loan driven.  And it's \\\"build it and they will \\ncome.\\\"  Right.  It's not about necessarily building industrial capacity or industries.  It's about \\nbuilding connectivity. \\n\\nAnd in this way, it makes it unique in the history; right?  Capitalists tend to want \\nto find cheaper labor so that they can make their products cheaper so they can make profits.  And \\nin that way, OBOR is somewhat unique because it's about building the connectivity into markets \\nrather than actually building capacity in those markets to export back to make more money.  That \\nmakes it quite unique. \\n\\nAnd it's epitomized by three changes in the economic arena, which were \\nsummarized by Professor Ren Xiao at Fudan.  I'll just summarize them very briefly.  One is the \\nsheer size of the thing is much bigger.  Second is it's going out further than ever before; hence, \\nour discussion here of the implications for different countries.  And it does suggest a geostrategic \\nshift to the West, right, where China had traditionally had these relationships with Central Asia, \\nthe historic Silk Road, et cetera, whereas over the last since China's reform and opening up in \\n'78, we've seen China mostly focus on Japan, Korea, the United States. \\n\\nIf you look at China's trade portfolio, it's overwhelmingly with developed \\ncountries, and this is a way to almost balance that.  And so that makes it again a unique change \\nfrom what we've seen in the past. \\n\\nSo let me break my next five minutes up into two parts.  First would be what \\nwould success look like?  And then I want to lie out for you a couple of possible risks that I see. \\n\\nEconomically, success would mean deploying excess capacity, and I could say \\nthis would be the priority, not only, however, in terms of capital construction but also in terms of \\nlabor.  China, remember, has 30 million extra men it needs to deploy.  So it's not only about \\ncapital; it's also about labor.  So this is very much a domestic stimulus program. \\n\\nSecond, China would have to be repaid.  If you lend somebody money, you hope \\nto be repaid, or it should gain something in return--equity stakes, what have you. \\n\\nAnd third, we would expect the internationalization of the RMB to be part of this \\nprocess.  If any one of these three things would fail to happen, it would be hard to see BRI as an \\neconomic success. \\n\\nPolitically, China's influence would have to go up in the countries where BRI is \\nactive.  If you have BRI, and you have less influence at the end of the day, that is not a political \\nsuccess.  So politically speaking, China has to increase its influence, the Party to Party linkages \\nand other linkages. \\n\\nCulturally, China would become, quote, \\\"a cultural major power.\\\"  Now this is \\n\\n134\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nquestionable because China itself had a Cultural Revolution where it destroyed its own culture.  \\nSo the question of how you then export a culture where you tried to destroy yourself is a \\nquestion.   \\n\\nChina also for those of us who have been there, Chinese clothes are now Western \\nclothes; Chinese sports are Western sports.  What would exporting Chinese culture look like?  I \\nwould say this is a question mark, but Xi Jinping has put it forward so I mention it. \\n\\nAnd then strategically, China would create what Professor Di Dong Shang [ph] at \\nRenda calls \\\"an alternate solar system contrary to the U.S. solar system.\\\"  And this refers back to \\nthis idea as China as the Middle Kingdom, which by the way it still calls itself in Chinese.  So \\nthe idea of China as the middle, the kind of pole, the nexus, of trade and political linkages is an \\nimportant part of One Belt One Road. \\n\\nSo let me in my last three minutes then get into the possible crises that I see \\ncoming out of this, and we can discuss this later.   \\n\\nFirst thing I would say, perhaps most probable, and I'm not really sure how this \\nwould unfold, but some kind of domestic debt crisis.  Until this point, One Belt One Road has \\nbeen primarily domestic.  We've seen in Hunan alone a trillion dollars in renminbi.  Far more has \\nbeen spent domestically than internationally.   \\n\\nAnd this, this suggests that a lot of companies, a lot of provincial governments, \\nwhich had found it hard, they had been liquid short, they didn't have the money, they had a \\nracking up debts, and they didn't have the liquidity to do the projects they wanted, have now \\nfound a way through One Belt One Road to gain the liquidity they need and to build up their \\ninfrastructure domestically. \\n\\nAnd if you look at a lot of the maps of One Belt One Road, you'll see there's this \\nvast domestic component of it which starts I think in like Fujian and then goes all the way up, \\nand that domestic component is going to be a major expenditure, and it's a lot easier to do that \\nbecause it's within the Chinese Communist Party's hands at this point so they're moving forward \\non that first. \\n\\nAnd so the question is when you have a massive amount of debt, which this \\nCommission has looked at for years, and then you basically triple down on that, what's the \\noutcome?  And I'm no soothsayer.  I don't know exactly, but I do know that, you know, how long \\ncan this go on, and what we're seeing is a doubling, tripling down on debt-driven growth.  In a \\nlot of ways that's what the Communist Party of China has done for a long time. It's not surprising \\nthat it would kind of revert back to this approach. \\n\\nDomestic inflation crisis is also something we might see, and let's not forget this \\ntook down the KMT.  This has taken down a lot of governments over time.  I call it the silent \\nkiller because you never know when it's actually going to strike, but if you keep bailing out \\nbanks, you keep pumping liquidity into the market, eventually the money isn't worth what it used \\nto be, and that's the nature of economics. \\n\\nAnd the question is what will One Belt One Road's influence be on the money \\nsupply in China?  I would say an international debt crisis--if we see the kind of One Belt One \\nRoad that Xi Jinping wants to create--is possible simply because we are in an economic upswing \\nnow.  If you lend on an upswing, the downswing happens, questions of pay back, questions of \\nmoral hazard, countries coming saying I need to renegotiate, then five more countries, then ten \\nmore countries, you could end up in this rolling landslide of renegotiations. \\n\\nAnd if you did end up with a crisis, you're now working at a level far beyond the \\nIMF's ability to bail out countries.  All right.  And at that point, working without a net, you begin \\n\\n135\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nto be concerned about global systemic crisis. \\nMoreover, with the new bond link to Hong Kong, Americans can now buy \\n\\nChinese bonds.  If the Chinese securitize One Belt One Road debt, which they are doing \\ndomestically although not internationally yet, as I understand it, then that could mean an \\ninternational securitization.  Think 2008, 2009, in terms of the systemic possibilities. It doesn't \\nmatter if it's backed up by a bad house in Detroit or a bad loan to Tajikistan, a bad loan is a bad \\nloan; a bad bond is a bad bond. \\n\\nSo there is this systemic crisis.  But at this point, internationally, there isn't the \\nsize to warrant a concern on that yet although domestically I would say there is. \\n\\nIn terms of security crisis, we've seen this around the world, we've seen it in \\nLibya, we've seen it in Yemen.  The more Chinese people you put on the ground, the more \\npossibility they have to be harmed, in harm's way, and the more possible security crises that \\ncould emerge. \\n\\nLet's not forget the history of the Opium War, where a failure of the British to in \\nterms of their product, at that point, opium, led to a military conflict.  We could see a situation--\\nI'm not predicting it, but it's not impossible--where the Chinese find an economic crisis leads \\nthem into a security crisis whether they wanted it or not. \\n\\nIf I might just have a couple more minutes to list my last two points. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Please. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  I would say that one thing the Chinese should be particularly \\n\\nconcerned about is a speculation crisis.  If you do internationalize the renminbi, you put a huge \\namount of renminbi out into the world, and that makes it possible for foreigners to buy that \\nrenminbi and then leverage it against your country if they want to.  If they don't like your \\npolicies, they can sell renminbi.  The price of the renminbi would fall; you'd have to intervene in \\nthe markets in order to prevent that from happening. \\n\\nSo the more externalization through One Belt One Road leads to more possibility \\nof speculation crisis.  \\n\\nThere's also a possibility of a political crisis.  Xi Jinping is as human as anyone in \\nthis room.  It's his initiative.  If something were to happen to him, the initiative would be put into \\nquestion, and I can just leave it at that.  We can think of many different other political crises, but \\nI think that's, you know, he's a mortal, period. \\n\\nAnd then I would say the most difficult crisis for China might actually be an \\nidentity crisis; right?  China is not the borrower anymore; it's now the lender.  Its meta-narrative \\nof the defender of the developing countries that it has been advocating since the Mao era and \\ncontinues today could be challenged if China is seen to be a predatory lender.  If its image is \\nharmed in that way, it has serious reputational risks for the way that other countries perceive of \\nit, but also the way that Chinese see themselves and their role in the world.  \\n\\nChina is fond of telling others that it is a country that loves peace and loves \\ndevelopment.  And if those are called into question through One Belt One Road, then that \\nquestions, as I said, the entire meta-narrative that the Communist Party has been promulgating. \\n\\nSo I would say these are the potential risks, and I'm happy to talk about them or \\nmy written testimony.  \\n\\nThank you so much, commissioners. \\n\\n136\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSHUA EISENMAN \\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT \\n\\nAUSTIN  \\n\\n137\\n\\n\\n\\nContextualizing China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \\n\\nWritten testimony for the USCC submitted on January 19, 20181 \\n\\nJoshua Eisenman, Ph.D.  \\n\\nAssistant Professor \\n\\nLBJ School of Public Affairs \\n\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin \\n\\n[NOTE: This testimony places the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the larger strategic context \\n\\nof China\\u2019s longstanding political-economic relations with the developing world.

Overview\\n\\nOn May 14, 2017, over 1,500 people, including twenty-nine national leaders and delegates from \\n\\n130 countries, gathered at the China National Convention Center in the Olympic Center in \\n\\nBeijing to hear President Xi Jinping\\u2019s remarks opening the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) \\n\\nConference. \\u201cWhat we hope to create is a big family of harmonious co-existence,\\u201d Xi said, then \\n\\nannounced another 100 billion yuan ($14.49 billion) for the Silk Road Fund, bring the total to \\n\\nnearly $55 billion. Moreover, he added: \\u201cThe China Development Bank and the Export-Import \\n\\nBank of China will set up special lending plans respectively worth 250 billion yuan and 130 \\n\\nbillion yuan to support Belt and Road cooperation.\\u201d During the group photo, Xi was flanked by \\n\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey\\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who both \\n\\nspoke at the ceremony. Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn summed up the mood \\n\\namong the attendees: \\u201cChina has taken the leadership in laying the foundations for the realization \\n\\nof our shared vision for an open, fair and prosperous world. Achievement of this vision will \\n\\nrequire our political commitment and a huge sum of resources.\\u201d1 \\n\\nFor centuries, Western observers have predicted that China would someday emerge as a major \\n\\npolitical and economic force in regional and world affairs and\\u2014as the 2017 BRI Conference and \\n\\ndozens of similar events demonstrate\\u2014that day has arrived.  \\n\\nThe pace and scope of China\\u2019s emergence has been breathtaking. Between 2000 and 2016, \\n\\nChina\\u2019s real GDP increased more than fourfold to roughly $11.4 trillion at the 2016 exchange \\n\\n1 This testimony is derived from the forthcoming book: Joshua Eisenman and Eric Heginbotham, eds., China Steps \\n\\nOut: Beijing\\u2019s Major Power Engagement with the Developing World (London: Routledge, 2018). \\n\\n138Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nrate;2 its foreign trade climbed from $642 billion to $3.7 trillion (in 2016 dollars);3 and its share \\n\\nof the global economy grew from 3.6 percent to 14.9 percent.4 Over the last three years, Chinese \\n\\nFDI, which was about $70 billion in 2013, exceed $170 billion in 2016.5 When Beijing \\n\\nabandoned isolation and began its economic \\u201copening\\u201d to the world in the mid-late 1970s, even \\n\\nthe most optimistic Chinese policymaker could not have predicted such a precipitous expansion \\n\\nof global engagement.  \\n\\nUnder the \\u201cgoing out\\u201d strategy, which was first advanced in 1997 and formally initiated in 1999, \\n\\nChinese firms have been transformed from novice newcomers to global powerhouses, and \\n\\nbecome deeply enmeshed in international trade, banking, and mergers and acquisitions.6 The \\n\\ngrowth in China\\u2019s trade with the developing world has consistently outstripped that with the \\n\\ndeveloped world, and Beijing\\u2019s policy banks (most notably the China Ex-Im Bank and China \\n\\nDevelopment Bank) have deployed hundreds of billions in capital in an unprecedented global \\n\\ninfrastructure financing campaign that dwarfs that of the World Bank.  \\n\\nAfter the 2009 global financial crisis, Chinese leaders came to believe that the historic trend \\n\\ntowards multipolarity had accelerated and that developing states were becoming ever more \\n\\nimportant economic, political and military partners. China\\u2019s new self-confidence was reflected in \\n\\nXi Jinping\\u2019s notion of \\u201cmajor power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics\\u201d and his call to \\n\\nshape the international environment more proactively.7 China has become an increasingly active \\n\\nparticipant in international institutions, taking a leading role in United Nations peacekeeping \\n\\noperations and almost doubling its contributions to and vote share in the International Monetary \\n\\nFund.8 Beijing has also created and funded numerous Sino-centric regional organizations (e.g., \\n\\nthe China-Africa Cooperation Forum and the China-Community of Latin American and \\n\\nCaribbean States Forum) that provide regional venues for Chinese leadership. Other \\n\\norganizations like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) enhance the perception that \\n\\nChina has emerged as the champion of globalization, though it is unclear whether such \\n\\ninstitutions complement or challenge existing international institutions.9  \\n\\nSince 2013, Beijing\\u2019s \\u201cgoing out\\u201d policy has been expanded into the ambitious BRI initiative \\n\\nchampioned by President Xi Jinping. To cope with excess industrial and construction capacity \\n\\nand gain higher returns, the financing of infrastructure has been accelerated under the BRI. To \\n\\nhelp Chinese state-owned and private firms take advantage of new economic opportunities in \\n\\nlesser-developed regions, China has policy banks and other funding mechanisms (e.g., the China \\n\\nEx-Im Bank, China Development Bank, the China-Africa Development Fund, and the Silk Road \\n\\nFund) to lend money to foreign governments to execute infrastructure projects employing \\n\\nChinese firms. The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, unlike the others, is a \\n\\nmultilateral institution, but it is also part of China\\u2019s larger international development and trade \\n\\npromotion strategy. According to an official media outlet: \\u201cWith the \\u2018Belt and Road\\u2019 initiative \\n\\nand other strategies serving as a powerful engine\\u2026 China\\u2019s overseas investment will continue to \\n\\nmaintain a double-digit growth rate.\\u201d10 \\n\\nYet, China\\u2019s ambitious push into the developing world, now headlined by BRI, has not been \\n\\nwithout setbacks and problems. China\\u2019s economic slowdown, especially the sharp downturn \\n\\nafter 2015, precipitated a drop in global commodity prices and raised new questions about the \\n\\nprofitability of many government-driven commodity investments. Similarly, after making tens of \\n\\n139Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nbillions in politically-driven loans at favorable rates to countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, \\n\\nand Sri Lanka, China now faces problems recouping its money. The question is whether BRI will \\n\\nreverse these trends or, more likely, exacerbate them. \\n\\nAsymmetric trade and investment relations have engendered concern among leaders in numerous \\n\\ndeveloping countries, and, in some cases, drawn protests from local populations. China\\u2019s \\n\\ngrowing hard power, combined with its more assertive approach to territorial and boundary \\n\\nissues in the South China Sea, has also caused some states around China\\u2019s periphery to seek \\n\\ncloser military or strategic ties with the United States and Japan. Farther afield, in the Middle \\n\\nEast and to a lesser extent Africa, Beijing\\u2019s commitment to neutrality and non-interference in \\n\\nregional disputes are increasingly being tested as its economic interests expand in ways that \\n\\nrequire it to behave like a more traditional major world power.  \\n\\nII. China\\u2019s Strategic Objectives in the Developing World\\n\\nThere are various formulations of China\\u2019s \\u201ccore national interests\\u201d (\\u6838\\u5fc3\\u5229\\u76ca), but all assume \\n\\nthree overlapping objectives.11 First, China\\u2019s leaders seek to ensure the continued rule of the \\n\\nCommunist Party; second, they seek to maintain and defend China\\u2019s sovereignty and territorial \\n\\nintegrity; and third, they want to maintain an international environment conducive to China\\u2019s \\n\\ncontinued economic growth.  \\n\\nDespite propaganda efforts to portray Chinese policies as rooted in solidarity with the developing \\n\\nworld, the drivers of Chinese policies remain primarily domestic, and regime survival remains \\n\\nBeijing\\u2019s foremost objective, informing all other interests. The priority on regime survival is \\n\\nevident in the content and character of its diplomacy, party-to-party relations, defense of \\n\\nsovereignty norms in international politics, and in its near single-minded emphasis on economic \\n\\ndevelopment.12 As Deng Xiaoping said in 1992: \\u201cDevelopment is the hard truth\\u201d (\\u53d1\\u5c55\\u662f\\u786c\\u9053\\n\\n\\u7406).13 At Davos in 2017, Xi\\u2014in a comment reminiscent of both Deng and U.S. President \\n\\nAbraham Lincoln\\u2019s Gettysburg Address\\u2014said: \\u201cDevelopment is of the people, by the people and \\n\\nfor the people.\\u201d14  \\n\\nThe emphasis on economic growth and domestic stability naturally shapes China\\u2019s engagement \\n\\nwith the developing world. Chinese leaders view economic growth and welfare as central to \\n\\nregime survival, and they view trade as a critical engine of growth. For more than a decade, \\n\\ndeveloping countries have supplied the minerals, metals, timber and energy demanded by the \\n\\nChinese industrial, construction and manufacturing sectors. To secure steady access to those \\n\\nresources, Chinese companies have, since the early 2000s, moved to purchase upstream energy \\n\\nand mineral assets, primarily in developing countries. These countries have also become \\n\\nimportant outlets for Chinese consumer products, enabling Chinese firms to build brand loyalties \\n\\nin emerging markets.15  \\n\\nImproved living standards are integral to Xi\\u2019s \\u201cChina Dream,\\u201d with its goal of achieving a \\n\\n\\u201cmoderately well off\\u201d society (\\u5c0f\\u5eb7\\u793e\\u4f1a) by 2021. For many years, officials in Beijing viewed \\n\\nrapid economic growth as essential to absorbing China\\u2019s growing workforce and avoiding social \\n\\ninstability. Since the Third Plenum of the Communist Party\\u2019s 18th Congress, however, leaders \\n\\nhave emphasized balanced growth, environmental protection, and eliminating structural \\n\\n140Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nimbalances within the economy. That said, old habits die hard. Local and many central \\n\\ngovernment officials continue to use GDP growth rates as the yardstick of success. Moreover, \\n\\nXi\\u2019s \\u201cMade in China 2025,\\u201d is a plan to comprehensively upgrade and strengthen the country\\u2019s \\n\\nmanufacturing capability. Nevertheless, as wage structures continue to shift in China and as \\n\\nenvironmental concerns mount, labor-intensive industries (e.g., textiles and leather goods) will \\n\\ncontinue to shift production to developing states.   \\n\\nThe developing world is also a locus of Beijing\\u2019s efforts to maintain or defend its \\u201cterritorial \\n\\nintegrity.\\u201d After a \\u201cdiplomatic truce\\u201d from 2008 to 2016, the competition for diplomatic \\n\\nrecognition between Taipei and Beijing appears to have resumed with the election of Tsai Ing-\\n\\nwen in Taiwan. In its quest to contain separatist impulses in Tibet, China periodically sanctions \\n\\ncountries and foreign organizations that give the Dalai Lama a platform or afford him anything \\n\\napproaching recognition.16 Chinese activities to secure its claims to features in the South China \\n\\nSea have included the use of hard power and coercive measures directly against rival claimants. \\n\\nChina has also solicited public support from at least 66 mostly-developing countries for \\n\\nrecognition of its maritime territorial claims in the South China Sea, and employed a variety of \\n\\neconomic and political means to purchase the loyalty of the smallest and weakest states in \\n\\nASEAN (Laos and Cambodia) to divide the organization and prevent unified opposition from \\n\\ncoalescing.17 \\n\\nMore broadly, China has found common interests with developing states on a range of political-\\n\\neconomic issues (e.g., environmental priorities and trade-offs, trade policy, technology standards, \\n\\nand the form and function of international institutions) and has sought to partner with the largest \\n\\nof them to foster a more \\u201cdemocratic\\u201d international order. Interests on these issues often align \\n\\nacross regime types. Despite India\\u2019s long history of vibrant democratic governance, New Delhi\\u2019s \\n\\nvotes in the UN General Assembly on various issues are more closely aligned with those of \\n\\nBeijing than they are with Washington\\u2019s.18 In Beijing\\u2019s case, support for norms related to state \\n\\nsovereignty and non-intervention are motivated by a desire to insulate itself from international \\n\\ncondemnation, sanctions and intervention related to its human rights abuses and harsh policies \\n\\ntoward minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang. \\n\\nIII. Structure of China\\u2019s Political-Economic Engagement with Developing Countries\\n\\nChina\\u2019s relations with developing countries display three principal characteristics: first, Beijing \\n\\nbenefits from and sometimes exploits asymmetry in its relations with developing countries; \\n\\nsecond, China pursues a \\u201cpackage\\u201d approach \\u2013 bringing economic, political, and other means to \\n\\nbear in a coordinated, albeit imperfect, manner; and third, Beijing advances its interests through \\n\\na network of interlocking and self-reinforcing bilateral, regional, and global engagements. Each \\n\\ndeveloping country\\u2019s ability to derive benefits from its relationship with China depends primarily \\n\\non its ability to develop and implement a coordinated national strategy that carefully considers \\n\\nthe combined implications of these three characteristics over the short, medium, and long term. If \\n\\na developing country ignores these realities or fails to consider their full implications, it is \\n\\nunlikely to achieve its own objectives vis-\\u00e0-vis China; a much larger, richer, and generally, better \\n\\ncoordinated state.  \\n\\nAsymmetric Engagement \\n\\n141Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nAsymmetry is the most pervasive and enduring aspect of nearly all of China\\u2019s bilateral \\n\\nrelationships, a fact that then-Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi reminded a security forum of the \\n\\nAssociation of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) of in 2010 when he said: \\u201cChina is a big \\n\\ncountry and other countries are small countries, and that\\u2019s just a fact.\\u201d19 Indeed, China\\u2019s nominal \\n\\nGDP ($11.4 trillion in 2016) dwarfs every developing country and is more than double the \\n\\ncombined GDP of India ($2.3 trillion), Brazil ($1.8 trillion), South Africa ($280 billion).20 In \\n\\n2016, Chinese exports made up more than half of all exports from the developing world.21  \\n\\nAlthough asymmetry is ever-present in China\\u2019s relationships with nearly all developing \\n\\ncountries, Beijing can choose to either highlight and exploit it or downplay it. China\\u2019s \\n\\ncomprehensive \\u201cpackage\\u201d approach (discussed immediately below) magnifies the perception of \\n\\nasymmetry, while egalitarian diplomacy and calls for \\u201cbrotherhood\\u201d and \\u201cequality\\u201d diminish it. \\n\\nRegional forums like FOCAC and the China\\u2013Community of Latin American and Caribbean \\n\\nStates (CELAC) Relations Forum invariably alternate locations between China and different \\n\\npartner countries in these regions. Symbolically, this places China on par with entire regions and \\n\\npractically it enhances Beijing\\u2019s already disproportionate agenda setting power. Beijing never \\n\\nfails to play the impressive and gracious host, with banquets replete with constant references to \\n\\nsolidarity, state-sovereignty, and the equality of all nation states.   \\n\\nComprehensive Engagement \\n\\nChinese foreign policy involves \\u201cmulti-centric, multi-layered and multi-pivotal sub-networks of \\n\\nregional and international cooperation that are interconnected and interwoven,\\u201d explained former \\n\\nVice Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei.22 Chinese foreign policy also now emphasizes a \\n\\nbroad array of collaborative enterprises including foreign aid, educational and cultural \\n\\nexchanges, media cooperation, military assistance and training, and political cadre training. \\n\\nBeijing looks to combine these elements (discussed individually below) into a comprehensive \\n\\npackage that creates synergies among China\\u2019s various interests and allows the state to target \\n\\nresources and apply leverage to achieve its objectives. The breadth of Beijing\\u2019s \\u201ccomprehensive \\n\\ndiplomacy\\u201d is well illustrated in its November 2016 white paper on Latin America and the \\n\\nCaribbean, which lists five broad areas of cooperation (i.e., political, economic, social, cultural, \\n\\nand peace and security) subdivided into 37 specific programs.  \\n\\nChina\\u2019s economic diplomacy, party-to-party relations, military diplomacy, and cultural outreach \\n\\nis often woven into a package that appears irresistible. China\\u2019s policy banks have become the \\n\\ndeveloping world\\u2019s go-to lenders. Between these, and its massive state-owned commercial \\n\\nbanks, China has 20 of the largest 100 banks in the world (ranked by total assets).23 China\\u2019s \\n\\nstate-owned and semi-private infrastructure and telecoms firms have become the face of the \\n\\ncountry\\u2019s overseas presence, building railroads, dams, airports, highways, and fiber optic \\n\\nnetworks for dozens of countries.  \\n\\nTo be sure, not all of China\\u2019s overseas engagement is state directed\\u2014or even directly state \\n\\nsupported. Chinese small and mid-sized Chinese entrepreneurs (which account for a rapidly \\n\\ngrowing, and often unaccounted for, share of overseas trade and investment) generally operate \\n\\nindependently in the developing world.24 Even large SOEs target deals based primarily on \\n\\n142Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nprospective profitability, and they have proven willing in rare cases to resist political pressure to \\n\\ninvest in deals they deem unpromising.25 Nevertheless, Beijing can influence investment \\n\\ndecisions and frequently does so to further its political objectives.   \\n\\nWhile economic tools are perhaps the most persuasive in Beijing\\u2019s toolkit, China\\u2019s \\n\\ncomprehensive engagement goes beyond economics, and aims to build a stable, multifaceted, \\n\\nand mutually beneficial set of bilateral relationships. Chinese leaders have recognized that \\n\\nbroader relationship must be \\u201chigh-quality\\u201d and go beyond profits to include a \\u201csense of justice\\u201d \\n\\n(\\u4e49\\u5229\\u89c2).26  \\n\\nInterlocking Engagement \\n\\nWhile all major states conduct diplomatic activities at the bilateral, regional, and global levels, \\n\\nChina\\u2019s engagement consists of a particularly tight latticework of institutionalized relationships, \\n\\nand its focus on creating or interfacing with regional organizations is distinctive in the degree, if \\n\\nnot type, of effort involved. By building a dense network of interlocking relationships, Beijing \\n\\nhopes to build a stable and mutually reinforcing structure that will further its interests.    \\n\\nAlthough China\\u2019s creation of regional organizations is among the most distinctive features of \\n\\nBeijing\\u2019s approach to the developing world, its bilateral relations remain the foundation. \\n\\nMultilateral forums boost legitimacy and visibility, but binding deals are primarily pursued \\n\\nbilaterally. China\\u2019s approach towards individual countries is tailored in accordance with \\n\\nBeijing\\u2019s specific interests there. China\\u2019s relations with nearby states are generally deeper and \\n\\nmore complex, with a mix of political, and economic interests, and sometimes territorial \\n\\ndisputes, at play. Beijing\\u2019s more distant relationships, by contrast, tend to prioritize economic \\n\\nobjectives. China\\u2019s relations with emerging major developing powers (including the BRICS \\n\\ncountries and the developing members of the G-20) cut across regional lines and also tend to be \\n\\nmultidimensional\\u2014with several overlapping political, economic, and security components.  \\n\\nAcross the developing world, Beijing has deepened its bilateral relationships and maintains \\n\\n\\u201cstrategic partnerships\\u201d with some 67 states.27 Within each region, Beijing places considerable \\n\\nemphasis on its relations with large and important anchor or \\u201chub\\u201d states where circumstances of \\n\\ngeography, politics or economics make relations with China particularly propitious. These \\n\\nrelationships tend to receive more attention in Beijing and be relatively stable over time. In East \\n\\nAsia, they include Indonesia and Thailand; in South Asia, Pakistan and India; in Central Asia, \\n\\nKazakhstan; in Africa, South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia; in the Middle East, Iran; and in Latin \\n\\nAmerica, Brazil and Argentina. This list is not definitive, and has and will continue to evolve \\n\\nover time. For example, some states, like Venezuela under Hugo Chavez, received special \\n\\nattention and financing from Beijing for a limited period of time for political reasons. Small, but \\n\\nstrategically located states, like Cambodia and Laos, are more susceptible to Chinese influence, \\n\\nand have served as useful \\u201cnail-house\\u201d votes in consensus-governed ASEAN.  \\n\\n143Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pattern of deepening engagement with regional institutions is replicated across every \\n\\ndeveloping region. Beijing established relations with ASEAN in 1991, and today is involved in \\n\\neleven ASEAN ministerial-level mechanisms across a wide range of economic, political, \\n\\ncultural, and security areas. It has maintained an ambassador to ASEAN since 2008, and has \\n\\nparticipated in the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area since 2010.28 In Latin America, China was \\n\\nadmitted as a permanent observer to both the Organization of American States (OAS) and Latin \\n\\nAmerican Parliament in 2004. In January 2015, Beijing and Latin American leaders held the \\n\\ninaugural meeting of the China-CELAC Forum, at which Xi Jinping established a target for \\n\\nChinese investment in Latin America of $250 billion within ten years.29 Notably, the CELAC \\n\\nforum, unlike the OAS, does not include the United States. \\n\\nChina\\u2019s regional diplomacy in Africa is orchestrated largely under the Forum on China-Africa \\n\\nCooperation (FOCAC), which convened its first Ministerial Conference in Beijing in October \\n\\n2000. In 2006, FOCAC was elevated to a Ministerial-level Summit, with meetings held every \\n\\nthree years. China and Arab partners established the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum \\n\\n(CASCF) in 2004.30 The CASCF and China-Gulf Cooperation Council strategic dialogue \\n\\nestablished in 2010 have allowed Beijing to expand relations with the Sunni-dominated Gulf \\n\\nStates, which had been limited by China\\u2019s close relations with Shia Iran.31  \\n\\nSince the 1980s, China has become an increasingly active contributor to international \\n\\ninstitutions. China\\u2019s participation reassures other states that it is committed to the international \\n\\nsystem, provides venues to advance Chinese interests, and helps \\u201clock in\\u201d Chinese policymakers \\n\\nin ways that help reduce conservative domestic opposition to reform. China\\u2019s expanded \\n\\ninvolvement in global institutions also serves to highlight and promote Beijing\\u2019s efforts to lead \\n\\nthe developing world by reforming and shaping global institutions. Beijing has pushed for years \\n\\nto change quotas and vote shares in the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank, \\n\\nalthough the process has been painfully slow.32 In the World Bank, it has advocated greater \\n\\ntransparency in the selection of the president and an end to Western dominance, and has \\n\\nconsistently sought to expand the prominence of the G-20 vis-\\u00e0-vis the G-7.33  \\n\\nIV. BRI and China\\u2019s Development-first Political-Economic Engagement\\n\\nBRI (i.e. concessionary debt financing) \\n\\nDevelopment with Chinese characteristics has gone global. BRI seeks to create a new Sino-\\n\\ncentric era of globalization using both traditional tools of Chinese statecraft as well as new types \\n\\nof economic incentives and debt financing arrangements. For two decades, China has promoted a \\n\\n\\u201cgoing-out\\u201d policy among its SOEs. Financing for Chinese-built projects in developing countries \\n\\ncomes from a variety of sources, the most important being China\\u2019s policy banks established in \\n\\n1994 to finance projects important to Chinese economic growth. The Export-Import Bank of \\n\\nChina (China Ex-Im Bank) and the China Development Bank provide large volumes of soft \\n\\nloans to developing countries under the condition that they hire Chinese SOEs to complete \\n\\nprojects.34 The loan portfolio of these two banks and 13 regional funds exceed the $700 billion \\n\\noutstanding loans from all six western-backed multilateral banks combined (including the World \\n\\nBank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, European Investment \\n\\nBank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and African Development Bank).35  \\n\\n144Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Chinese leaders conduct summit meetings, they often travel with large business \\n\\ndelegations and sign MoUs worth hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. In Islamabad in \\n\\nApril 2015, for example, Xi Jinping and Pakistan\\u2019s President Nawaz Shari signed 51 MoUs \\n\\nworth nearly $28 billion as the first phase of a larger Pakistan-China Economic Corridor Project \\n\\nsaid to be worth more than $50 billion.36 During the December 2015 FOCAC meeting, Xi \\n\\nJinping pledged some $60 billion in funding support, mostly in the form of loans and export \\n\\ncredits and $5 billion in assistance to Africa.37 Once terms are reached with a host country, funds \\n\\nmay be transferred directly into the Beijing-based bank accounts of China\\u2019s state-owned \\n\\nenterprises, which execute the project using Chinese materials and labor. \\n\\nThe dollar values discussed at these meetings hold out the promise of profits and economic \\n\\ngrowth for smaller partner nations. But MOUs are, of course, not legally binding contracts and \\n\\nmany do not reach fruition or remain decades in the future. Others involve deals for which \\n\\nnegotiations had been ongoing (in some cases for years), but which are pushed forward to \\n\\ncorrespond with a political meeting or leaders\\u2019 summit. \\n\\nIn October 2013, the BRI became the overarching framework for this effort. Somewhat \\n\\nconfusingly, the \\u201cbelt\\u201d portion is continental, while the \\u201croad\\u201d portion is maritime. The Silk \\n\\nRoad Economic Belt (SREB) runs through Central Asia, West Asia, the Middle East, and \\n\\nEurope. The Maritime Silk Road (MSR) connects China to countries in Southeast Asia, Oceania, \\n\\nand parts of North and East Africa\\u2014the South China Sea, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean \\n\\nregions. Designed to improve connectivity between China and more than 60 countries, BRI is \\n\\noverseen by the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \\n\\nand Ministry of Commerce, all under the auspices of the State Council.38 Projects include \\n\\nvirtually all types of transportation infrastructure, including rail, roads, ports, airports, electricity \\n\\ngeneration, telecommunications and various other forms of connectivity.39 \\n\\nIn October 2013, the same month that BRI was introduced, Xi Jinping announced China\\u2019s \\n\\nintention to establish the AIIB, which will complement the BRI initiative. The AIIB began \\n\\noperations in December 2015 with 57 founding member states\\u201437 from Asia and 20 outside of \\n\\nit.40 Initial capital was $100 billion, about two-thirds of the capital of the Asian Development \\n\\nBank and about half that of the World Bank.41 Although the AIIB is headquartered in Beijing, its \\n\\npresident reports to an international board, and although China holds the largest voting bloc (26 \\n\\npercent) it remains a minority stakeholder. Beijing has also created the Silk Road Fund, backed \\n\\nby China\\u2019s sovereign wealth fund but open to private investors.42 Established in December 2014, \\n\\nthe Silk Road Fund is capitalized at roughly $55 billion.43 The AIIB\\u2019s slow start and the Silk \\n\\nRoad Fund\\u2019s limited scale means that the preponderance of financing for BRI projects come \\n\\nfrom China\\u2019s policy banks.44  \\n\\nWhile there are many unanswered questions about the initiative, it is clear that BRI takes China\\u2019s \\n\\nfinance and infrastructure construction efforts to a new, and far riskier, level. Beijing intends to \\n\\nallocate at least $1 trillion to the initiative, and scores of multinational corporations, both \\n\\nChinese and foreign, are angling take full advantage.45 The framework has subsumed many \\n\\nprojects that were being considered long before BRI was launched, but the unquestioned political \\n\\nbacking implied by writing BRI into the CPC constitution may lead to more projects being \\n\\n145Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nlaunched with less careful assessment of likely risks and returns.  Because these projects involve \\n\\nloans, heavy BRI funding may exacerbate the debt problems of already poor states and further \\n\\nburden deeply indebted Chinese banks. China now owns more than half of some African nations\\u2019 \\n\\nforeign debt, and many expect Beijing will have to write off significant portions in the years \\n\\nahead.   \\n\\nInvestment \\n\\nDeveloping countries play a central role in China\\u2019s \\u201cgoing out\\u201d foreign investment strategy. As \\n\\nearly as 1999, China had amassed about $155 billion in foreign reserves and was looking to gain \\n\\nreturns while generating work for its SOEs.46 That year, at the Fourth Plenum of the 15th \\n\\nNational Party Congress, Jiang Zemin launched the so-called \\u201cgoing out strategy\\u201d encouraging \\n\\nfirms to \\u201cestablish branches overseas\\u201d and \\u201cexplore international markets.\\u201d47 Subsequent \\n\\ndecisions during the 2000s provided funding mechanisms to facilitate outward investment. \\n\\nChina\\u2019s move outward began slowly\\u2014and primarily involved SOEs in the extractive and \\n\\nconstruction industries\\u2014but has diversified and gathered momentum since 2010. China\\u2019s non-\\n\\nfinancial FDI flow increased from $3.6 billion (in 2016 USD) in 2003 to some $141.2 billion in \\n\\n2015\\u2014a real compound annual growth rate CAGR of 36 percent.48   \\n\\nAccording to official figures, as of 2015 about 57 percent of China\\u2019s total (outward) FDI stocks \\n\\nwere in developing states (excluding investment in offshore financial centers), with the largest \\n\\naccumulations in Asia (25 percent of total), Africa (12 percent), and Latin America (5 percent).49 \\n\\nIn some sectors, Chinese firms also have their own sizable war chests and may sometimes prefer \\n\\nto invest their own funds. Much of CNOOC\\u2019s $15 billion 2012 purchase of Canada\\u2019s Nexen, for \\n\\nexample, came from CNOOC\\u2019s own cash reserves.50 Notably, although Chinese investment in all \\n\\nthese regions has increased markedly over the last decade, it is often not the largest investor. For \\n\\nexample, Chinese investments in Africa during 2014 accounted for seven percent of all FDI in \\n\\nthe region, far less than France\\u2019s 21 percent.51 In 2015, Chinese investment in Africa dropped to \\n\\njust three percent of the global total.52 China accounted for about 9.5 percent of total FDI in \\n\\nSoutheast Asia in 2016, Japan accounted for about 14.5 percent and the United States for about \\n\\n12 percent.53 In short, China has gone from having virtually no FDI stake in these regions to \\n\\nbeing a major player. But it is not the singularly dominant actor it is sometimes portrayed as, but \\n\\nrather one among several important investors.  \\n\\nTrade  \\n\\nAnother important BRI objective is expanding and promoting trade, which enables China to \\n\\nleverage comparative advantages to grow its economy\\u2014with attendant benefits for the Chinese \\n\\npeople and state capacity. Trade growth is not necessarily purely, or even necessarily primarily, a \\n\\nfunction of state-led promotion activities, but Beijing is using BRI to tip the balance in favor of \\n\\nits firms and suppliers. Chinese corporations, including SOEs, private and semi-private firms, \\n\\noften work closely with state policy banks and diplomats, who are empowered to help promote \\n\\nexports. According to one analysis, Chinese commercial service attaches working in China\\u2019s \\n\\nAfrican embassies outnumber U.S. Foreign Commercial Service officers working in the region \\n\\nby some fifteen to one.54 \\n\\n146Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rapid expansion of Chinese trade has become a key driver of GDP growth. GDP grew by a \\n\\nreal compound annual growth rate of 9.1 percent between 1978 and 2015, while trade increased \\n\\nby an average of 12 percent. Trade growth has slowed considerably since 2012, partly due to \\n\\ngovernment policies designed to enhance domestic consumption and, more importantly, the \\n\\nslowing of the Chinese economy.55 China\\u2019s trade grew by a 3.52 percent in 2014, shrank by 9.85 \\n\\npercent in 2015 and shrank again by 4.02 percent in 2016.56 These trends are even more \\n\\npronounced in China\\u2019s trade with developing countries. Private firms accounted for 38.1 percent \\n\\nof trade in 2016.57 \\n\\nFor China, developing countries have become increasingly important raw material suppliers and \\n\\nare growing markets for its manufactured products. China\\u2019s trade with developing countries has \\n\\ncome to account for an increasing percentage of the country\\u2019s overall trade volume. In 1990, \\n\\ndeveloping countries represented only 15 percent of total Chinese trade, but by 2000, that figure \\n\\nhad grown to 19 percent, and by 2010, it had reached 31 percent. After peaking around 34 \\n\\npercent in 2012, the percentage has plateaued, as China\\u2019s economic slowdown has reduced the \\n\\nneed for raw materials and the price of oil and metals like copper and iron ore has fallen. If and \\n\\nwhen commodity prices fully recover, developing countries are likely to once again regain their \\n\\nleading position.  \\n\\nThe value of China\\u2019s trade with the developing world was $29.4 billion in 1990 (measured in \\n\\nconstant 2016 USD) and rose to $1.2 trillion in 2016 (about 33 percent of China\\u2019s total foreign \\n\\ntrade)\\u2014a real CAGR of 15.4 percent\\u2014compared to a 12.1 percent CAGR for China\\u2019s total trade \\n\\nover that period. China\\u2019s trade volume by region were: Southeast Asia, 12.4 percent of total \\n\\nChinese trade; the Middle East, 5.5 percent; Latin America, 5.7 percent; Africa, 4.1 percent; \\n\\nSouth Asia, 3 percent; and Central Asia, 0.9 percent.58 \\n\\nEconomic Assistance \\n\\nChina provided substantial economic assistance to developing states during the 1950s, 1960s, \\n\\nand early 1970s, but cut back on those expenditures in the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as it \\n\\nsought to rebuild its own economic position. Over the last decade, however, foreign aid has \\n\\nreemerged as an important part of the Chinese foreign policy toolkit, and Beijing released white \\n\\npapers on the subject in 2011 and 2014. The budget for foreign assistance has grown rapidly over \\n\\nthe last decade, with an average annual increase of 29.4 percent between 2004 and 2009. \\n\\nBetween 2009 and 2012, China\\u2019s aid disbursements totaled $14.4 billion, or about a third of \\n\\nChina\\u2019s total aid from 1950 to 2008.59 Unfortunately, the Ministry of Commerce, which \\n\\ncoordinates China\\u2019s assistance programs, does not provide year-on-year tracking, complicating \\n\\nsystematic evaluation.  \\n\\nChinese economic assistance comes in three varieties: grant aid (36 percent of the 2009-2012 \\n\\ntotal); interest-free loans (8 percent); and concessional loans (56 percent).60 These funds go to \\n\\nsupport a wide range of programs: emergency assistance, technical aid and instruction, health \\n\\ncare and medical facilities, low cost housing, education, state capacity building, infrastructure \\n\\ndevelopment, and environmental protection. In terms of distribution, some 52 percent went to \\n\\nAfrica over this period, 31 percent to Asian states, and 8 percent to Latin America and the \\n\\nCaribbean.61  \\n\\n147Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChina\\u2019s approach to foreign assistance differs in several respects from the members of the \\n\\nOECD\\u2019s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), private Western donors like the Gates \\n\\nFoundation, and multilateral institutions like the World Bank. Rather than poverty alleviation, \\n\\nChina\\u2019s assistance, particularly its concessionary loan aid, is primarily focused on infrastructure \\n\\ndevelopment tied to Chinese business contracts. It is nearly always distributed on a state-to-state \\n\\nbasis. Unlike Western countries and institutions which often place economic or political \\n\\nconditionality on their aid, Chinese aid does not require subsequent audits and comes with \\u201cno \\n\\npolitical strings attached.\\u201d  \\n\\nThe predictable result is that Chinese aid is often easier for corrupt foreign leaders to \\u201ccapture\\u201d \\n\\nand channel towards politically important regions, constituencies, and cronies.62 While China\\u2019s \\n\\nforeign aid programs could focus more on grants and interest free loans and made more \\n\\ntransparent to safeguard against abuse by recipient governments, the approach taken by the DAC \\n\\nstates and the Bretton Woods Institutions has also faced criticism. Angus Deaton, who won the \\n\\n2015 Nobel Prize in Economics for work on poverty, argues that the West\\u2019s approach to aid \\n\\n\\u201cundermines what poor people need most: an effective government that works with them for \\n\\ntoday and tomorrow.\\u201d63 Some therefore favor of China\\u2019s \\u201cdevelopment first\\u201d approach, with its \\n\\nfocus on state capacity and infrastructure.64 \\n\\nV. Soft Power with and Political Outreach\\n\\nBeijing\\u2019s impetus to become a \\u201ccultural major power\\u201d (\\u6587\\u5316\\u5927\\u56fd) predates Xi. A broad \\n\\nconceptual framework was adopted in 2004 under the official formulation \\u201cChina\\u2019s peaceful \\n\\nrise,\\u201d and a subsequent white paper was issued in 2011, as both a guide for Chinese \\n\\npolicymakers and an effort to reassure anxious foreigners. Since 2013, however, Xi Jinping has \\n\\nspoken repeatedly on the need to increase China\\u2019s \\u201csoft power\\u201d (\\u8f6f\\u5b9e\\u529b) by, among other \\n\\nthings, creating a compelling Chinese narrative and strengthening Beijing\\u2019s capacity to convey \\n\\nits message overseas.65 \\u201cSoft power\\u201d is the ability of one nation to shape the preferences of \\n\\nothers through its appeal and attraction at the popular, elite, or government levels.66 Because soft \\n\\npower helps shape others\\u2019 preferences, it increases the perception of congruence between \\n\\nChinese interests and those of others.67 \\n\\nAccording to Chinese analysts, the nation\\u2019s history makes it a \\u201ccultural major power\\u201d with great \\n\\nnatural advantages.68 In 2004, Beijing launched the Confucius Institute program to cultivate the \\n\\nstudy of Chinese language and culture abroad. According to the Confucius Institute Headquarters \\n\\nwebsite, in 2016 there were 500 institutes around the world. Although these are clustered in \\n\\ndeveloped countries, with 109 in the United States alone, many developing states also host \\n\\ninstitutes. Skeptics question whether Beijing-backed Confucius Institutes are being used to \\n\\ninfluence university research agendas and impinge on academic freedoms.69  \\n\\nChina promotes other types of \\u201cperson-to-person\\u201d exchanges, including foreign students \\n\\nstudying in China. Beijing sponsors tens of thousands of foreign youths for training both in their \\n\\nhome countries and at Chinese universities and vocational schools. According to the Ministry of \\n\\nEducation, there were 442,773 international students studying in China in 2016, up from about \\n\\n290,000 in 2011. Of foreign students in 2016, some 49,022 received scholarships from the \\n\\n148Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChinese government, an increase of 20 percent from 2015.70 In 2016, more than 264,976 foreign \\n\\nstudents in China hailed from Asia, but thousands of students are from other developing regions. \\n\\nFor at least two consecutive years, the greatest increase was in the number of students from \\n\\nAfrica, who numbered some 61,594 in 2016, up 23.7 percent from 2015. China is looking to \\n\\nexpand job opportunities for graduates, so it can retain and utilize these young Chinese-speaking \\n\\nforeigners.71  \\n\\nChina\\u2019s influence in developing countries has expanded under President Xi, who in 2014 \\n\\nexhorted his comrades: \\u201cWe should increase China\\u2019s soft power, give a good Chinese narrative \\n\\nand better communicate China\\u2019s messages to the world.\\u201d72 Chinese language schools, media \\n\\ntraining, cultural exchanges, educational and training programs, and other forms of aid and \\n\\nassistance have increased China\\u2019s soft power in many countries.73 \\n\\nMeanwhile, Beijing is spending more time and resources hosting and visiting counterparts from \\n\\ndeveloping countries\\u2019 political parties than ever before. Outreach by the International \\n\\nDepartment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (ID-CPC) is a historical \\n\\nand ongoing feature of Chinese foreign policy and supplements the diplomacy conducted by \\n\\nstate organs (e.g., the MFA) and leaders. The Party\\u2019s political outreach generally looks to engage \\n\\nin ways that avoids the appearance of intervention in domestic affairs. In autocracies, the ID-\\n\\nCPC may avoid interaction with the opposition, while in liberal democracies, it maintains ties \\n\\nwith both ruling and opposition parties.  \\n\\nIn Africa, the CPC has expanded its host diplomacy, cadre training, and outreach to political \\n\\nparties in Africa and throughout the developing world. China\\u2019s training programs are generally \\n\\noriented towards state capacity building and include, for example, training programs on the \\n\\nmanagement of agricultural technology programs. Other elements, like the political cadre \\n\\ntraining done by the International Department of the CPC Central Committee and media training \\n\\nprograms run by the official Xinhua News Agency, are explicitly political and are intended to \\n\\nimprove foreign perceptions of China and legitimize the ruling party. In 2014 and 2015, some \\n\\n2000 officials of South Africa\\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) were trained by the CPC, and \\n\\nBeijing is financing the ANC Political School and Policy Institute, modeled on the China \\n\\nExecutive Leadership Academy in Shanghai.74 Ethiopia was perhaps the earliest and most eager \\n\\nstudent of Chinese cadre training, and has dispatched delegations regularly to China since \\n\\n1994.75 During a public talk at Fudan University in Shanghai in May 2017, Arkebe Oqubay, a \\n\\nMinister and Special Advisor to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, identified party-to-party \\n\\nrelations as the first of three Sino-Ethiopian links (along with government-to-government and \\n\\npeople-to-people).76 \\n\\nOver the last decade, led by Xinhua and CCTV, China\\u2019s state-run media has advanced an \\n\\ninitiative to enhance China\\u2019s influence and international image.77 Since 2005, Xinhua has \\n\\nemphasized cooperation, content sharing, and media training programs with dozens of news \\n\\noutlets throughout the developing world.78 China wants to improve younger generations\\u2019 \\n\\nperceptions of its political system and gain elite support to counter what Beijing sees as Western \\n\\nefforts to portray Chinese practices in an unfavorable light. In 2017, for instance, Renmin \\n\\nUniversity in Beijing hosted a 10-month development studies and media exchange with 48 \\n\\nstudents from Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Training topics include China\\u2019s political, \\n\\n149Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\ncultural, media and economic studies. Counselor Liu Yutong, Chief of the Public Diplomacy \\n\\nDivision at the MFA\\u2019s Information Department, welcomed the journalists with a speech about \\n\\nChinese stability and growth\\u2014and questioned the wisdom of Britain\\u2019s exit from the EU and the \\n\\nU.S. election of Donald Trump.79 \\n\\nVI. Evaluating BRI and Countries\\u2019 Perceptions\\n\\nChinese engagement with the developing world has undoubtedly helped Beijing enhance the \\n\\nperceived legitimacy of the CPC, improve living standards for the Chinese people, and expand \\n\\nBeijing\\u2019s power and influence around the world. China has been largely successful in achieving \\n\\nthese aims, but it has also not been without setbacks, and the scale of risk has risen together with \\n\\nits overseas profile in recent years. China\\u2019s BRI and the \\u201cgoing out\\u201d strategy before it open \\n\\ndeveloping markets to Chinese-made products and expanded access to the raw materials China \\n\\nneeds to meet domestic demand. Its investments and loan financing for infrastructure, catalyzed \\n\\nthrough BRI initiative, have provided sustained opportunities to redeploy China\\u2019s considerable \\n\\nproductive capacity in the construction, telecom and other sectors. All of this facilitates China\\u2019s \\n\\npursuit of its centenary goals, the lifting of living standards for the Chinese people, the power of \\n\\nthe Chinese state, and (most importantly for China\\u2019s leaders) the perceived legitimacy of the \\n\\nCommunist Party.   \\n\\nWhile China\\u2019s BRI has been a diplomatic success to date, its future is uncertain. At home, \\n\\nChinese leaders understand that economic growth is overly dependent on investment and \\n\\nexports, though they remain ambivalent about rebalancing towards consumption-led growth. At \\n\\nthe same time, Beijing\\u2019s policy banks regularly finance projects regarded as too risky by Western \\n\\ncounterparts and the decline in commodities prices has exacerbated that risk.80 China\\u2019s existing \\n\\nloans to friendly governments in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Sri Lanka already portend tens of \\n\\nbillions of dollars in potential losses. China provided roughly $60 billion in loans and aid to \\n\\nVenezuela between 2007 and early 2016, and, as of mid-2016, the latter still owed China $20 \\n\\nbillion. But with oil prices stuck near $50 per barrel and Venezuela unable to service its debts \\n\\nfully, Beijing finally cut off new lending in September 2016.81  \\n\\nBRI represents a massive and unprecedented expansion of connected lending to international \\n\\nborrowers that enmeshes the already deeply indebted Chinese banking system in some of the \\n\\nworld\\u2019s most precarious economic and political environments. The lending program\\u2019s sheer size \\n\\nrequires Chinese government and party organs, many with little experience in international \\n\\noperations, to vet scores of projects across a myriad of regulatory, linguistic, and cultural \\n\\nenvironments. Many poor countries, especially in Africa, are happy to take cheap Chinese loans \\n\\nnow and let future leaders and citizens pay them back. China\\u2019s response has often been to grant \\n\\nloan forgiveness and then provide more loans, creating a serious moral hazard problem. Many \\n\\ngovernments are banking on China\\u2019s continued largesse and are thus happy to take whatever they \\n\\nare offered. However, Beijing, which saw its foreign reserves drop by more than 20 percent \\n\\nbetween 2014 and 2017, cannot write off bad loans ad infinitum.  \\n\\nBRI could also open new opportunities for fraud and corruption. China, which itself ranks an \\n\\nunimpressive 83 on Transparency International\\u2019s 2015 corruption index, is building hundreds of \\n\\nprojects in some of the least accountable countries in the world, such as Turkmenistan (154), \\n\\n150Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nKyrgyzstan (123), Cambodia (150), and Myanmar (147). On an OECD 8 point scale of risk by \\n\\nrecipient country, the portfolio of states that China\\u2019s banks extended loans between 2013 and \\n\\n2015 entailed an average risk rating a full point higher (i.e., more risky) than the World Bank\\u2019s.82 \\n\\nXi himself seemed to recognize the challenges when he called for a \\u201cstable, sustainable and risk-\\n\\ncontrollable financial security system\\u201d to supervise the BRI initiative.83 \\n\\nIn the political realm, Chinese diplomacy has generally been successful in developing \\n\\nrelationships and gaining influence. Beijing has certainly seen failures and setbacks, and has \\n\\naddressed such problems by expanding the depth and breadth of its bilateral political relations \\n\\nwith developing states and through existing and newly created multilateral regional \\n\\norganizations. By institutionalizing relations via diplomatic arrangements, party-to-party \\n\\ndialogues, economic agreements, military forums, and person-to-person exchanges, Beijing has \\n\\ncreated numerous overlapping buffers that enable the rapid return to normal relations if \\n\\nunexpected crises disrupt the relationship. \\n\\nChina\\u2019s overseas image is generally favorable, though it varies widely, depending on location \\n\\nand issue. According to a 2015 Pew survey conducted in 27 countries, an average of 55 percent \\n\\nof respondents hold a favorable image of China, compared to 69 percent for the United States. \\n\\nChina is viewed most favorably in Africa (average of 70 percent in nine countries) and Latin \\n\\nAmerica (57 percent average in six countries), while the perception is less positive in regions \\n\\ncloser to China, where security concerns weigh heavily, and in the Middle East, where many \\n\\nhave reservations about China\\u2019s treatment of its Muslim Uighur population. Those surveyed also \\n\\nhad a dim view of China\\u2019s respect for human rights, with just 34 percent having a favorable \\n\\nimpression.84  \\n\\nInfluence, which might be defined as the ability to bring about changes in another state\\u2019s \\n\\nintended behavior in ways that advance one\\u2019s own aims, is notoriously difficult to measure, as it \\n\\ninvolves counter-factual analysis. That said, China appears to have successfully influenced other \\n\\nstates on issues of marginal importance to the other state, where the costs of taking the desired \\n\\naction are small. Vague official statements supporting China\\u2019s position on the South China Sea, \\n\\nfor example, are costless for African and Middle Eastern states. Similarly, acquiescence to \\n\\nBeijing\\u2019s single-minded efforts to marginalize Taipei and the Dalai Lama, also have minimal \\n\\npolitical costs for states beyond China\\u2019s immediate periphery. South Africa, however, paid some \\n\\nprice for acceding to China\\u2019s demands when it refused the Dalai Lama a visa, prompting the \\n\\ncancelation of a conference of Nobel laureates in Pretoria.85 \\n\\nThere are few clear cases of China\\u2019s ability to translate its combined economic, political, military \\n\\nand soft influence into favorable outcomes when the stakes are high for the other state. However, \\n\\nChina\\u2019s efforts to minimize opposition to its consolidation of its territorial claims in the South \\n\\nChina Sea arguably represent a case of at least partial success. Beijing has achieved a fait \\n\\naccompli in the South China Sea by reclaiming 3,200 acres of land on seven features and thereby \\n\\nturning reefs and rocks into significant military outposts.86 Such measures have alarmed the \\n\\nstates most directly affected, including Vietnam and the Philippines, and fueled wariness in \\n\\nlarger regional states like Indonesia and Malaysia. Beijing has responded by offering a blizzard \\n\\nof trade and aid proposals and by leveraging its asymmetric relationship with Cambodia and \\n\\nLaos to thwart joint statements by ASEAN.  \\n\\n151Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChina\\u2019s impact on the economic, governance, and environmental welfare of the partner states in \\n\\nthe developing world is mixed. China is, by far, the largest trade partner of developing states in \\n\\nevery part of the world, and the loan portfolio of its policy banks and regional funds exceeds that \\n\\nof all Western multilateral banks combined.87 Chinese activity is stimulating growth and building \\n\\ninfrastructure in regions that are chronically short of capital and investment. Even in Southeast \\n\\nAsia, where Japan, the United States, and other Western countries are major actors, most states \\n\\nsuffer from infrastructure financing deficits.88 In sub-Saharan Africa, China\\u2019s aid and \\n\\ninvestments are distributed across a wider range of recipient states than is assistance from \\n\\nWestern states and international organizations. Some of the difference is explained by Beijing\\u2019s \\n\\nwillingness to engage the least savory African regimes, but it also reflects the more limited (and \\n\\nfocused) interests of Western firms, states, and international organizations in Africa.    \\n\\nNeedless to say, countries have been affected differently by their engagement with China. \\n\\nDuring the commodities boom of the 2000s and early 2010s, growth rates rose rapidly among \\n\\nresource-rich countries. At the same time, imports from China had significant displacement \\n\\neffects on domestic African and Latin American producers of labor intensive manufactured \\n\\nproducts, like textiles and food processing.89 The pattern was more mixed in East Asia, where the \\n\\nregion\\u2019s integrated production chains contribute to the specialization among states.90 Roughly 50 \\n\\npercent of Indonesian exports to China are raw materials, while Taiwan, Korea, and Malaysia \\n\\nexport mostly intermediate, capital, or consumer goods.91  \\n\\nChina\\u2019s corporations have a poor record of environmental protection at home, and they have \\n\\ncontributed to degradation overseas, especially when local governments suffer from poor \\n\\ncapacity, weak oversight, or endemic corruption. Some firms have been accused of cutting \\n\\ncorners, ignoring safety standards, using secondhand or low-quality materials and equipment, \\n\\nand building environmentally destructive projects. Complaints have come from Laos, Vietnam, \\n\\nand Cambodia regarding environmental damage and droughts from Chinese hydropower projects \\n\\nalong the Mekong River; from Indonesia regarding an ill-fated, over-budget coal power plant and \\n\\na failed high-speed rail project; from Myanmar regarding Chinese firms clear-cutting forests; and \\n\\nfrom Korea and West Africa about harm done to the marine environment by Chinese trawlers \\n\\nfishing practices.92  \\n\\nFacing growing public resentment at home, the Chinese government has become more attuned to \\n\\nenvironmental issues. It has passed new environmental regulations and promoted the State \\n\\nEnvironmental Protection Administration to ministerial status, changing its name to the Ministry \\n\\nof Environmental Protection in 2008.93 Both the Chinese state and its companies have adopted or \\n\\nsigned international compacts designed to protect the environment overseas.94 Nevertheless, \\n\\nenforcement responsibilities and oversight remains weak at home, and Beijing has even more \\n\\ndifficulties policing its corporations \\u2013 especially small- and mid-sized private firms \\u2013 overseas. \\n\\nChina\\u2019s lack of conditionality, lax oversight, and poor corporate citizenship contribute to, or at \\n\\nleast do not discourage, rent seeking and corruption in partner states.95 The problem is likely to \\n\\nworsen as rising labor costs in China push more \\u201cdirty\\u201d manufacturing to relocate to cheaper and \\n\\nless well-regulated developing countries.   \\n\\nChina\\u2019s expansion in the developing world may also adversely affect the spread of liberal values. \\n\\nAfter a remarkable wave of democratization from the mid-1970s to the mid-2000s, the tide \\n\\n152Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nappears to have turned. According to the 2017 Freedom House report, those countries \\n\\nexperiencing a net decline in freedom have exceeded the number experiencing a net gain every \\n\\nyear between 2006 and 2016. In 2016, 67 countries saw declines while just 36 improved.96 In \\n\\nsome countries, like Russia, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, autocrats have maintained the facade of \\n\\ndemocracy (e.g., elections and private press outlets) while stripping them of all meaning.97 \\n\\nOthers, like Ethiopia, seem to have more borrowed directly from China\\u2019s authoritarian state-led \\n\\ndevelopment model.  \\n\\nChina\\u2019s attractiveness as an economic model has increased due to its sustained economic growth \\n\\nand as neoliberal economic practices (broadly known as the Washington Consensus) have lost \\n\\nthe confidence of policymakers in developing states \\u2013 particularly in the wake of the global \\n\\nfinancial crisis of 2008. More recently, however, reduced growth rates and rising debt levels in \\n\\nChina have diminished the attractiveness of the \\u201cChina model.\\u201d Moreover, with the decline in \\n\\ncommodities prices, Chinese investments and debt financing for resource-related infrastructure \\n\\nhas saddled some countries with unsustainable debt again diminishing the popularity of China as \\n\\nboth partner and model. Only time will tell whether the billions of dollars Beijing has spent on \\n\\nenhancing and projecting its soft power \\u2013 the Confucius Institutes, CPC cadre training programs, \\n\\nXinhua media training, film festivals, think-tank exchanges, student scholarships, etc. \\u2013 will \\n\\nsucceed in improving perceptions of China. \\n\\nDespite these efforts to enhance Chinese \\u201csoft power,\\u201d however, many countries on China\\u2019s \\n\\nperiphery continue to harbor deep concerns about Beijing\\u2019s long-term ambitions and others are \\n\\ndeeply ambivalent about excessive dependence on trade with and investment from China. \\n\\nAddressing these concerns while pursuing Beijing\\u2019s material goals will challenge Chinese \\n\\nforeign policy leaders for the foreseeable future.   \\n\\nVII. Implications for the United States\\n\\nBeijing and Washington\\u2019s relations with the developing world are not primarily zero-sum. To a \\n\\nsignificant extent, interests are parallel\\u2014that is, separate and non-overlapping in either a \\n\\ncompetitive or cooperative sense. American firms benefit from improved global growth and \\n\\nimproved economic efficiencies that result from China\\u2019s policy banks financing tens of billions \\n\\nof dollars\\u2019 worth of transportation infrastructure around the developing world. Chinese raw \\n\\nmaterial purchases from Africa, for instance, are a link in the global supply chain. They supply \\n\\nChinese manufactures, which, in turn, sell their finished products to furniture stores from Boston \\n\\nto Beijing to Bangkok. But although Washington and Beijing pursue their economic and political \\n\\ninterests vis-\\u00e0-vis developing states in ways that often neither directly benefits nor harms the \\n\\nother, that dynamic could change if the Sino-U.S. relationship evolves dramatically for the worse \\n\\nor if the BRI precipitates a massive raft of loan defaults that destabilizes the international \\n\\neconomic system. \\n\\nIn some important respects, American and Chinese interests coincide. Both benefit from stability \\n\\nand prosperity in the developing world, yet they attribute these outcomes to different sources. \\n\\nWashington has long maintained that free and fair elections and an open society are essential for \\n\\nlong-term political stability, while Beijing believes that economic development is the primary \\n\\ncause.98 The bloody aftermath of the Arab Spring has dampened Washington\\u2019s interest in \\n\\n153Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nactively supporting democratic change through revolutionary means, though it continues to \\n\\npromote democratic and liberal values. After the election of Donald Trump, it remains to be seen \\n\\nwhether Washington will revert to traditional modes of active interventionism or adopt a more \\n\\nisolationist \\u201cAmerica first\\u201d foreign policy.  \\n\\nThe United States would be well served to deepen its political and economic presence and \\n\\ninfluence in the developing world. By many standards, U.S. engagement with and assistance to \\n\\nthe developing world in areas from health care and food aid, to institution-building, \\n\\nenvironmental leadership, military engagement, media, NGOs, and a raft of other areas remain \\n\\ndeeper and better considered than China\\u2019s. Yet many of these efforts gain little attention and are \\n\\nnot well understood. Of much greater concern, U.S. efforts could be severely undercut should \\n\\nfunding for the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and \\n\\nother parts of the U.S. foreign policy establishment be significantly reduced. The U.S. \\n\\ngovernment is already far less involved in promoting trade and investment than China. This puts \\n\\nU.S. firms at a disadvantage in competing with Chinese counterparts, and it undermines the \\n\\nlarger effort to maintain U.S. relevance in the developing world. Washington should increase \\n\\nfunding for the Foreign Commercial Service, U.S. Ex-Im Bank, and other federal programs that \\n\\nimprove U.S. corporations\\u2019 international competitiveness. The United States has the resources to \\n\\nmaintain its global leadership position; the question in these uncertain political times is whether \\n\\nit will choose to do so.  \\n\\n1 \\u201cQuotes from leaders at China\\u2019s New Silk Road meeting,\\u201d ABC News, May 14, 2017. \\n2 International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF), World Economic Outlook Database, gross domestic \\n\\nproduct, constant prices (national currency) and gross domestic product, current prices (U.S. dollars).

Wow.  And you can choose whatever \\n\\npace you wish, Mr. Harris. Slow or fast.  We will adjust. \\nThank you, Dr. Eisenman. \\nMR. HARRIS:  Good afternoon, commissioners.  Thank you for having me.  \\n\\nThank you also to the staff for just working with me to get me here. \\nIn the brief time I have today I want to talk about Japan's changing approach to \\n\\nthe BRI because right now that's actually a moving target as we speak, how the BRI fits with \\nJapan's broader regional economic strategy, and what lessons, finally, the U.S. can learn from \\nJapan. \\n\\nThe Japanese case is instructive because it shows that, on the one hand, building a \\npositive relationship with China may increasingly require engagement with the BRI in some \\nform.  The Abe government has studied BRI participation as part of a broader diplomatic \\ncampaign to stabilize Japan's relationship with China as the two countries mark the 40th \\nanniversary of their Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 2018. \\n\\nOn the other hand, however, Japan's long road to BRI cooperation shows that it is \\npossible, and even necessary, for Asia's wealthier democracies to pursue that own development \\nstrategies to help BRI members minimize their dependence and maximize their freedom of \\naction. \\n\\nJapan may not be able to match China's promises dollar for dollar, but through its \\nwillingness to increase its lending, implement reforms to its foreign assistance institutions, and \\npromote private investment by Japanese companies, Tokyo has arguably outlined a possible \\nresponse to the BRI, even as it considers participating in the Initiative. \\n\\nAfter years of keeping its distance from the BRI and with the United States \\nactively opposing the creation of the related Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Abe \\ngovernment is developing a strategy of limited cooperation with the BRI.  Japan's BRI strategy is \\nstill a work in progress so any conclusions at this point are tentative. \\n\\nHowever, what we know thus far suggests that the Abe administration is \\ndeveloping a strategy whereby Japanese public financial institutions, like the Japan Bank for \\nInternational Cooperation, JBIC, and the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance Corporation, \\nNEXI, will provide financial support for Japanese corporations working on BRI projects, \\nprovided the projects satisfy certain conditions, including transparency, profitability, debt \\nsustainability for the borrowers, and no possibility that the infrastructure could be converted to \\nmilitary purposes. \\n\\nIn this emerging policy, the Abe government is clearly trying to make cooperation \\nwith China under the BRI serve Tokyo's broader foreign economic policy goals rather than \\nshifting its regional strategy to prioritize the BRI. \\n\\nIn the five years since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to power, his \\ngovernment has promoted a massive increase in infrastructure exports as part of its Abenomics \\nprogram for revitalizing Japan's economy.  It issued, in February 2015, an updated Development \\n\\n159\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nCooperation charter that articulated the need for \\\"quality growth\\\" that is inclusive, sustainable \\nand resilient.  \\n\\nThereafter, it announced in May 2015 the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure, \\nwhich entailed a significant increase in funds for Japan's public lending agencies and the Asian \\nDevelopment Bank, the ADB, as well as reforms to lending practices. \\n\\nIt also announced in May 2016 the \\\"High-Quality Infrastructure Export \\nExpansion Initiative,\\\" which included an additional increase in funds and further lending \\nreforms.   \\n\\nAnd then most recently, in 2017, announced that it would with India pursue an \\nAsia-Africa Growth Corridor, a maritime connectivity project to enhance trade links between \\nSouth and Southeast Asia and East Africa.   \\n\\nAdditionally, even as Mr. Small discussed India has remained out of the BRI, \\nJapan has stepped up its official development assistance and public and private lending to India, \\ndemonstrating how China's rivals can use regional anxieties about the BRI to their advantage.   \\n\\nThese steps plus Japan's embrace of new rules for trade and investment in East \\nAsia through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which as we saw this week is now moving forward \\nwithout the United States, amount to a comprehensive strategy for competing with China for \\ninfluence across the Indo-Pacific. \\n\\nAs such, the Abe government is not ceding leadership in regional development to \\nChina, but it is recognizing that the Initiative does bring much needed investment to the region--\\ninvestment that Japan and the ADB have long recognized is necessary--and that whether or not \\nJapan participates, the BRI will go forward and could reshape the region over the coming \\ndecades. \\n\\nBy endorsing participation by Japanese firms, the Abe government will tacitly \\nacknowledge this reality and try to find ways for Japan to profit from the BRI and perhaps shape \\nthe Initiative on the margins in a way more friendly to Japanese interests and values. \\n\\nHaving articulated and pursued an independent strategy, Tokyo can pursue \\ncooperation with China on its own terms. \\n\\nI think at this point it's worth noting the contrast with Australia, another Indo-\\nPacific maritime democracy with a complex interdependent relationship with China.  Australia \\nhas shared Japan's interest in high-quality infrastructure to meet Asia's infrastructure gap, but \\nunlike Japan has not revamped its development institutions or increased its development \\nassistance and lending. \\n\\nUnlike Japan, Australia joined the AIIB as a founding member in 2015, which \\nperhaps signaled a greater willingness to work with China on infrastructure than Canberra \\nintended.  In the three years since Australia joined the AIIB, it has lurched between talks with \\nBeijing on BRI participation and hostility and perhaps even fearmongering regarding China's \\nintentions, including most recently a direct jab at Chinese development assistance in the South \\nPacific by Australia's Minister for International Development. \\n\\nWhereas Japan has kept its distance from the BRI and articulated its own regional \\ndevelopment strategy, Australia was quick to lend its support for a key institution but grew \\nambivalent and is now struggling to articulate an independent development strategy. \\n\\nIn fairness, this partly reflects Australia's smaller economy and smaller resources, \\nwhich has led Australia to focus more on soft infrastructure rather than hard infrastructure.  But \\nprecisely for that reason, Australia needs to identify its priorities, upgrade its institutions, perhaps \\ncreating development finance institutions like Japan's, and collaborate with regional partners to \\n\\n160\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\npromote high-quality infrastructure investment. \\nIf the BRI will be a fixture in Asia's economics and politics, the region's \\n\\ndeveloped democracies need their own plans for promoting development, particularly in the \\nregion's middle income countries.  Without a regional trade strategy aimed at middle-income \\nAsia, it is imperative for the U.S. to develop a development strategy that uses bilateral foreign \\naid, cooperation with the ADB and other multilateral lending institutions, and perhaps most \\nimportantly incentives to encourage private infrastructure investment in South and Southeast \\nAsia. \\n\\nGiven Japan's existing capabilities and influence, the U.S. should coordinate \\nclosely with Japan and follow Tokyo's lead in stressing the importance of high-quality \\ninfrastructure.  Developing a joint regional development strategy could be an appropriate agenda \\nitem for the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue, as well as for future meetings of the U.S.-Japan-\\nAustralia-India quadrilateral. \\n\\nBoth the administration and Congress deserve credit for taking steps to maintain \\nand even expand U.S. capacity for global development, first by preserving the Export-Import \\nBank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC, and going forward, through \\npending legislation to roll OPIC into a new, more robust development finance corporation. \\n\\nStrengthening capacity for supporting private efforts to meet Asia's infrastructure \\nneeds will make it possible for the United States to work more closely with its partners to \\ndevelop an allied approach to regional development that may not supplant BRI but will give the \\ndeveloping countries of South and Southeast Asia more freedom of action even as Chinese \\ninvestment proceeds. \\n\\nWith that, I will conclude my prepared remarks.  Thank you for your time. \\n\\n161\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nPREPARED STATEMENT OF TOBIAS HARRIS \\nECONOMY, TRADE, AND BUSINESS FELLOW, SASAKAWA PEACE FOUNDATION \\n\\nUSA  \\n\\n162\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\\n\\nChina\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative: Five Years Later\\nRegional Reactions and Competing Visions\\n\\n25 January 2018\\n\\nTobias Harris \\nVice President, Teneo Intelligence \\n\\nEconomy, Trade, and Business Fellow, Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA \\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to testify before the U.S.-China Economic \\nSecurity Review Commission today on the subject of regional reactions to China\\u2019s Belt \\nand Road Initiative (BRI). China\\u2019s USD 1tn program of infrastructure investment \\npresents opportunities for its sixty-five member countries to develop, while also raising \\nrisks of over-dependence on Chinese investment, unsustainable borrowing, and high \\nenvironmental and social costs for host nations.1 \\n\\nThe risks and opportunities of the BRI extend even to Asia\\u2019s developed democracies, \\nwhich already have complex economic relationships with China and interests in \\npromoting development across Asia. In my remarks today I will focus on how Japan \\u2013 \\nwhich is in the process of developing a strategy of limited engagement with the BRI \\u2013 \\nhas responded to the BRI, touching briefly on Australia to show some of the difficulties \\npresented by the BRI. The Japanese case is particularly instructive because it shows \\nthat on the one hand, building a positive relationship with China may increasingly \\nrequire engagement with the BRI in some form, while, on the other hand, showing that it \\nis possible and even necessary for Asia\\u2019s wealthier democracies to pursue their own \\ndevelopment strategies to help BRI members minimize their dependence on China and \\nmaximize their freedom of action. Japan may not be able to match China\\u2019s promises \\ndollar for dollar, but through its willingness to increase its lending, loosen rules and \\nimplement other reforms to its foreign assistance institutions, and to promote private \\ninvestment by Japanese companies Tokyo has arguably outlined a possible response to \\nthe BRI even as it considers participating in the BRI. \\n\\nJapan\\u2019s approach to the BRI not only provides a model for the US consider as it \\nformulates its own Asia policies, but also is an opportunity for the US to strengthen its \\nrelationships with Japan, Australia, and, increasingly, India, as they all determine how to \\nrespond to the BRI. \\n\\n163Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nJapan\\u2019s shift on the BRI\\n\\nAs we meet today, Japan\\u2019s approach to China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative is a moving \\ntarget. After years of keeping its distance from the BRI \\u2013 and, with the United States, \\nactively opposing the creation of the related Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) \\n\\u2013 the Abe government has signaled that it is developing a strategy of limited\\ncooperation with the BRI. Japan\\u2019s BRI strategy is still a work in progress, so our\\ndiscussion today must by necessity be tentative. However, what we know thus far\\nsuggests that the Abe administration is developing a strategy whereby Japanese public\\nfinancial institutions like the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and\\nNippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) will provide financial support for\\nJapanese corporations working on BRI projects, provided the projects satisfy certain\\nconditions, including transparency, profitability, debt sustainability for the borrower, and\\nno possibility that the infrastructure could be converted to military purposes. Early\\nreports suggest that public finance will focus on backing joint Japan-China projects\\nregarding the development of renewable energy infrastructure in third countries,\\npromoting high-speed industrialization in third countries, and the proposed rail\\nconnection between China and Europe.2\\n\\nThese conditions are largely consistent with the Abe administration\\u2019s focus on \\u201chigh-\\nquality\\u201d infrastructure investment, and, as such, do not necessarily signify a sharp break \\nwith its prevailing approach to regional development or its broader foreign economic \\npolicies. Instead, from what we know of the Abe government\\u2019s approach, the emerging \\npolicy shift is likely driven by pragmatic calculations that recognize the role that China \\nand the BRI will play in regional development, infrastructure investment, trade \\nfacilitation, and connectivity not just within Asia but between Asia and other regions. \\nThe Abe government is not ceding leadership in regional development to China but it is \\nrecognizing that the initiative does bring much-needed investment to the region \\u2013 \\ninvestment that Japan and the Japan-led Asian Development Bank (ADB)3 have long \\nrecognized as necessary \\u2013 and that whether or not Japan participates, the BRI will go \\nforward and could reshape Asia and much of the developing world over the coming \\ndecades. By endorsing participation by Japanese firms, the Abe government will tacitly \\nacknowledge this reality and try to find ways for Japan to profit from the BRI and \\nperhaps shape the initiative on the margins in a way more friendly to Japanese interests \\nand values. \\n\\nThe Abe administration\\u2019s shift is part of a broad recalibration of Japan\\u2019s foreign \\neconomic policies since the United States withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership \\nin January 2017. From Abe\\u2019s decision to join TPP talks in March 2013, the regional \\ntrade pact had been the predominant focus of the Abe administration\\u2019s foreign \\neconomic policy, as it provided a framework not only for addressing longstanding issues \\nin its bilateral relationship with the United States but also established \\u201chigh-quality\\u201d rules \\nthat would govern trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific in the twenty-first century. \\nWhile TPP\\u2019s origins predate the BRI, as the talks proceeded, it became increasingly \\nclear that for Japan, TPP was at least part of its answer to the BRI. While not explicitly \\nfocused on helping middle-income economies develop, the inclusion of Vietnam and \\n\\n164Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nMalaysia and the prospect of other Southeast Asian countries joining the bloc in the \\nfuture suggested an approach to development in which developing countries would, in \\nexchange for access to the markets of the US and other wealthy members (making \\nthem the agreement\\u2019s biggest beneficiaries in GDP terms4), undertake politically difficult \\ndomestic reforms that could fundamentally restructure their economies. As long as the \\nAbe administration was focused on implementing TPP as it was signed in February \\n2016, it could afford to remain aloof from the emerging China-led framework for regional \\ndevelopment.  \\n\\nUS withdrawal severely undermined the concept of TPP as development model, forcing \\nthe Abe government to rethink its overall approach to trade, investment, and \\ndevelopment in Asia. While Tokyo eventually decided to lead the bid to revive the TPP \\nwithout the US \\u2013 now the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-\\nPacific Partnership (CPTPP) \\u2013 without the US, it was not nearly as beneficial or as \\nappealing to the developing-country members, and Vietnam and Malaysia repeatedly \\nsignaled their skepticism about the post-US TPP. The Abe government appeared more \\nsupportive of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) after the US \\nleft TPP, but the larger, more economically diverse membership of RCEP meant that it \\nwas never going to satisfy Japan\\u2019s desire to advance higher standards for regional \\nintegration \\u2013 and it is possible that the Abe government\\u2019s insistence on raising RCEP\\u2019s \\nstandards, which Abe and other officials repeated after the US withdrew from TPP, \\nindicated that Tokyo was more interested in slowing RCEP\\u2019s progress rather than \\nguiding them to completion. The other difference, of course, is that RCEP included \\nChina, meaning that unlike TPP it would not be a tool for reshaping China\\u2019s economic \\npractices or help Asian countries reduce their dependence on China. Therefore, after \\nthe US withdrawal from TPP, Japan was left with a trade agreement that did not have \\nthe same appeal to middle-income Asia while facing a China that was aggressively \\nexpanding its ambitions for integration through the BRI framework. \\n\\nThe result is that beginning in spring 2017 the Abe administration began articulating a \\nmulti-faceted updating of its foreign economic policies. Despite Abe\\u2019s dismissing the \\nvalue of TPP without the US on multiple occasions,5 the prime minister decided that \\nJapan would throw its weight behind efforts to revive the agreement without the US and \\nset an ambitious goal of finalizing the revisions by the Asia Pacific Economic \\nCooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam in November 2017. Additionally, it would also \\npush to conclude an economic partnership agreement (EPA) with the European Union, \\ntalks for which had begun in 2013. By pursuing these agreements, especially the TPP-\\n11, Japan would show that even as the US shifted away from multilateral to bilateral \\nand unilateral approaches to trade, the multilateral trading system was still deepening \\non multiple fronts \\u2013 and Japan was still invested in advancing new rules to govern \\ncommerce in the twenty-first century. Meanwhile, in May Japan and India announced \\nthe creation of the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), an infrastructure investment \\ninitiative that appeared to be a direct challenge to the BRI. \\n\\nAt the same time, however, the Abe government began quietly but purposefully \\nsignaling to Beijing that Japan is open to participating in the BRI in some capacity. Even \\n\\n165Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nas Japan was resurrecting TPP and assuming leadership of the bloc of eleven, the Abe \\ngovernment began making overtures to Beijing. The clearest sign of a shift came in mid-\\nMay, when Abe dispatched Takuya Imai, his principal private secretary, along with the \\nLiberal Democratic Party\\u2019s (LDP) secretary general Toshiro Nikai, widely regarded as a \\nleading LDP \\u201cChina hand\\u201d to Beijing to attend the Belt and Road Forum. During this \\nvisit, Nikai met with Xi and conveyed a letter from Abe expressing the prime minister\\u2019s \\nhopes for an exchange of visits and more constructive bilateral engagement. This \\ndelegation communicated the Abe administration\\u2019s seriousness regarding \\nrapprochement with Beijing, in which cooperation under the auspices of the BRI could \\nplay a central role.  \\n\\nWhen Abe met Xi on the sidelines of the G20 in Hamburg in July 2017, the joint \\nstatement included the first mention of BRI \\u2013 \\u201cJapan and China will discuss how to \\ncontribute to the stability and prosperity of the region and the world, including the One \\nBelt, One Road initiative.\\u201d6 By November, when Abe met Xi and Chinese Premier Li \\nKeqiang on the sidelines of APEC, the language had been upgraded: the joint \\nstatement with Xi now said, \\u201cThe two sides shared the view [emphasis added] that they \\nwill together discuss how Japan and China will contribute to the stability and prosperity \\nof the region and the world, including the \\u2018the Belt and Road\\u2019 Initiatives.\\u201d7 The joint \\nstatement from Abe\\u2019s meeting with Li two days later included the same language but \\nalso noted:  \\n\\nBoth sides shared the view that Japan and China should cooperate with each \\nother in order to deepen and expand their win-win economic relationship, and \\nthat developing Japanese and Chinese businesses in third countries will be \\nbeneficial not just to Japan and China but to the development of the countries \\nconcerned as well. They also shared the view that exchanges in the business \\ncommunity should be promoted.8 \\n\\nThis point from the Abe-Li summit is particularly important because it directly anticipates \\nthe policy approach the Abe government eventually indicated it would adopt in \\nDecember 2017, whereby it would provide financial support for Japanese firms working \\non BRI projects but not directly participate in the BRI or join the AIIB. This trajectory has \\ncontinued since the start of 2018. On 10 January, Abe met with Nikai and Yoshihisa \\nInoue, secretary-general of the LDP\\u2019s coalition partner Komeito (which has its own \\nconnections to China) and reiterated that Japan\\u2019s cooperation with the BRI would be on \\na case-by-case basis, with decisions made on the basis of the aforementioned criteria \\nas well as from consideration of China\\u2019s preferences.9 \\n\\nPolitical drivers\\n\\nAs surprising as Japan\\u2019s embrace of the BRI has been, it bears stressing that Japan\\u2019s \\nembrace is thus far not only still pending but also looks to be modest: private-sector-led \\ninvestment with government backing, with no indication that Japan will change its \\nstance on non-participation in the AIIB. While Tokyo is learning to live with the evolving \\nChina-led development regime, it is not prepared to jump in with both feet and, as will \\n\\n166Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nbe discussed in the next section, is still focused on its own initiatives. This is not a grand \\nstrategic realignment, the birth of something like what former Prime Minister Yukio \\nHatoyama called an \\u201cEast Asian Community.\\u201d10 Rather, it is driven mainly by domestic \\npolitical considerations, which, as the Council on Foreign Relation\\u2019s Sheila Smith has \\nnoted, have increasingly played an outsized role shaping Japan\\u2019s China policies.11 \\n\\nFirst, the Abe government has signaled that it wants to use the fortieth anniversary of \\nthe Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship as an opportunity to put the bilateral \\nrelationship on a more stable footing. The two governments have not minimized the \\nsignificant obstacles to a genuine sea change in their relationship \\u2013 the territorial \\ndispute and broader competition in the East China Sea, Japanese concerns about \\nChina\\u2019s support for North Korea, and tensions regarding China\\u2019s burgeoning military \\npower \\u2013 but have agreed that bilateral dialogue with a view towards building a stable \\nrelationship is worthwhile. As 2017\\u2019s joint statements recognized, economic cooperation \\nwill be an important factor for restoring trust between the two countries. The expectation \\nis that the commitment to stabilizing the bilateral relationship will lead to an exchange of \\nhigh-level visits, including visits by Xi and Li to Japan and Abe to China and the drafting \\nof a new bilateral communiqu\\u00e9 that would highlight the importance of bilateral economic \\ncooperation, particularly through the BRI.  \\n\\nPublic opinion polls suggest that the Japanese public is broadly supportive of efforts to \\nstrengthen bilateral cooperation. The annual survey of public opinion in Japan and \\nChina conducted by Japanese think tank Genron NPO found that while sources of \\ndistrust remain, especially the dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, the Japanese \\npublic is increasingly less pessimistic about the state of the relationship at present and \\nless pessimistic about the future of the relationship. 12  The 2017 poll, which was \\nreleased in December, suggests that Abe can count on domestic political support for \\nreaching out to Beijing. The poll found: \\n\\n\\u2022 59.2% of Japanese believe \\u201ca new, stronger cooperating relationship should\\nbe established between the two countries for the sake of a stable and\\npeaceful order\\u201d;\\n\\n\\u2022 40.7% of Japanese believe that \\u201c[strengthening] trust between the two\\ngovernments\\u201d would be useful for improving the relationship;\\n\\n\\u2022 The share of respondents who identified China as a country that poses a\\nmilitary threat to Japan fell from 66.6% in 2016 to 45.3% in 2017.\\n\\nThe perception that China is less threatening to Japan and that it is important for the \\ntwo governments to work together stands in stark contrast to the years following the \\n2010 collision between Japanese Coast Guard and Chinese fishing vessels near the \\ndisputed islands and the 2012 standoff following Japan\\u2019s \\u201cnationalization\\u201d of the islands, \\nafter which Japanese public hostility to China rose sharply.  \\n\\nHowever, while the public is more open to bilateral cooperation, the Genron NPO poll \\nshows that the Japanese public is also highly skeptical about the prospects for \\neconomic cooperation. Only 27% of respondents (9.7% strongly, 17.3% relatively) \\n\\n167Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nagreed that the two economies\\u2019 complement each other, \\u201cmaking it possible to build a \\nwin-win relationship.\\u201d A plurality \\u2013 35.9% - expects that economic relations will worsen \\n(although this was an improvement over 2016 when 44.2% were pessimistic). Only \\n8.6% said Japan should cooperate with China\\u2019s economic plans; a large majority \\n(61.4%) was not sure. The implication is that while the public is supportive of diplomatic \\nmeasures to reduce tensions and strengthen cooperation, the Japanese people are not \\nnecessarily clamoring for Japan to follow China\\u2019s economic leadership. Whether \\nintentionally or not, the Abe government\\u2019s approach appears to fall at this sweet spot. \\nFor the same reason, the Japanese government\\u2019s approach could be highly sensitive to \\nincidents in the East China Sea, such as the recent passage of a Chinese submarine \\njust outside territorial waters near the disputed islands, which prompted protests from \\nthe Japanese government.13 \\n\\nAt the same time that the Abe government is sensitive to the opportunities and \\nconstraints presented by changing public attitudes towards China, it is also sensitive to \\nthe Japanese business community\\u2019s interest not just in a stable relationship but in the \\nbusiness opportunities arising from the BRI. It is not clear just how widespread interest \\nin the BRI is among Japanese firms: a May 2017 Reuters survey found that 95% had no \\ndesire to participate in the BRI and no firms were currently considering participation in \\nBRI projects.14 However, it is entirely possible that business sentiment changed once \\nthe Abe government signaled that Japanese participation (with public financing) was \\npossible. One indicator of corporate Japan\\u2019s enthusiasm is advocacy in favor of BRI \\nparticipation by the leadership of Keidanren, Japan\\u2019s leading business federation. \\nKeidanren chairman Sadayuki Sakakibara attended the Belt and Road Forum at \\nBeijing\\u2019s invitation; approved of references to BRI cooperation in the 2017 Abe-Xi joint \\nstatements, noting that Japanese businesses were especially interested in \\u201cconnectivity \\ninfrastructure\\u201d projects;15 and led a business delegation to China in November during \\nwhich he argued that bilateral cooperation through the BRI would benefit not just the \\ntwo countries but the whole world.16 Meanwhile, the joint statement produced by the \\nKeidanren-hosted Japan-China CEO Summit in December included a BRI plank that \\nstated: \\u201cBoth sides agreed to work closely with each other in close cooperation in third-\\ncountry markets in which both countries\\u2019 companies can demonstrate their superiority \\nwithin the \\u2018One Belt, One Road\\u2019 framework.\\u201d17 (In his remarks at a reception for the \\nsummit, Abe noted that Sino-Japanese cooperation on infrastructure could \\u201ccontribute \\ngreatly to the prosperity of Asian peoples\\u201d and suggested the possibility of cooperation \\nas part of the BRI, but also said such cooperation would be under Japan\\u2019s \\u201cFree and \\nOpen Indo-Pacific Strategy\\u201d framework.18)  \\n\\nAt a basic level, Keidanren\\u2019s support for Japanese participation likely reflects concerns \\nthat by foregoing participation, Japanese firms \\u2013 which have already been engaged in a \\nfierce competition with Chinese firms for infrastructure projects across the region \\u2013 \\nwould be operating at a disadvantage in the race to build the infrastructure Asia\\u2019s \\nmiddle-income countries need to develop. Corporate Japan\\u2019s concerns likely include not \\nonly the advantages that Chinese firms could enjoy but also firms from other economic \\nrivals, including South Korea, Germany, and France, which have signaled their \\nwillingness to cooperate with China through the BRI. Corporate Japan\\u2019s influence \\n\\n168Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nshould not be overstated: its voice carries weight in government deliberations, but it \\ndoes not necessarily make the government\\u2019s policies. Nevertheless, in this case, given \\nthe Abe administration\\u2019s focus on creating new market opportunities for Japanese firms \\noverseas and promoting Japanese exports, including infrastructure, the administration \\nwas likely receptive to corporate Japan\\u2019s arguments that if Japan remained outside of \\nthe BRI, Japanese firms would miss profitable opportunities. However, it is too early to \\nsay how many Japanese companies will participate in the BRI, in what countries and on \\nwhat projects they will work, and just how profitable participation will be. \\n\\nJapan\\u2019s regional development strategy\\n\\nAs Abe\\u2019s aforementioned remarks at the Japan-China CEO Summit suggest, Japan\\u2019s \\nparticipation in the BRI will occur within the existing framework of Japan\\u2019s regional \\ndevelopment, trade, and investment strategies. Japan has contributed to the \\ndevelopment of Southeast and South Asian countries since the early 1950s, beginning \\nwith reparations during the early postwar period and continuing to significant amounts of \\nofficial development assistance (ODA) and investment as Japan\\u2019s economy achieved \\ntakeoff growth. In a broad sense, Japan\\u2019s postwar approach to ODA and investment in \\nAsia\\u2019s developing countries anticipated what China is trying to accomplish through the \\nBRI. The Japanese government recognized that by investing in the industrialization of \\nAsia\\u2019s less-developed countries \\u2013 particularly through energy infrastructure and \\n\\u201cconnectivity\\u201d infrastructure like roads and ports \\u2013 it could create overseas market \\nopportunities for Japanese firms and exports, strengthen Japan\\u2019s political influence in \\nstrategically important countries, and secure access to energy supplies and other \\nresources needed for Japanese producers.19 \\n\\nWhile over time Japan has directed more resources to poverty alleviation in least-\\ndeveloped countries, its development strategy has remained preoccupied with the \\neconomic development of Southeast and South Asia. For example, in 2015, Japan\\u2019s \\ntotal gross ODA disbursements were roughly USD 12bn, approximately half of which \\nwent to Asia \\u2013 including USD 3.2bn to Southeast Asia and USD 2.46bn to South Asia. \\nRevealingly, the two largest recipients of Japanese ODA were India and Vietnam, which \\nreceived USD 1.54bn and USD 1.42bn in ODA respectively. Both countries are, of \\ncourse, increasingly important strategic partners for Japan and targets for Japanese \\nforeign direct investment as they become integrated in Japanese supply chains.20 \\n\\nHowever, as China has grown wealthier and began using its resources to promote \\neconomic development through infrastructure construction in Asia and elsewhere in the \\ndeveloping world, Japan has found itself locked in a competition with China to win \\nprojects, preserve market share, and maintain political influence across Southeast Asia \\nafter decades of being the region\\u2019s preeminent economic power.21 As a result, the Abe \\nadministration has upgraded its approach to regional development in order to preserve \\na leadership role for Japan even in the face of what has been described as China\\u2019s \\n\\u201cMarshall Plan\\u201d for the twenty-first century. At the same time, as the Abe government \\narticulated Abenomics, its program for revitalizing Japan\\u2019s economy, it identified \\ninfrastructure exports as a source for potential growth, meaning that competition with \\n\\n169Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChina and Asia\\u2019s \\u201cinfrastructure gap\\u201d presented Japan with a major opportunity. \\nTherefore, in March 2013, the administration created a prime ministerial advisory \\ncouncil to develop a strategy for infrastructure exports and develop new tools for \\nproviding public support for Japanese exporters. The government established a target \\nof JPY 30tn in orders for infrastructure exports by 2020, three times larger than the JPY \\n10tn Japan exported in 2010. Abe and other senior officials have persistently used \\nforeign trips to promote Japan\\u2019s infrastructure systems, especially high-speed rail and \\nsubway and electrical systems (including nuclear power). \\n\\nAs the Abe government developed this approach, it recognized that Japan would not be \\nable to match China in quantitative terms and has therefore articulated a regional \\ndevelopment strategy focused on \\u201cquality.\\u201d The February 2015 revision of Japan\\u2019s \\nDevelopment Cooperation charter stresses the need for \\u201cquality growth\\u201d that is \\ninclusive, sustainable, and resilient.22 In Asia, this would entail \\u201cboth physical and non-\\nphysical infrastructure including that which is needed for strengthening connectivity and \\nthe reduction of disparities both within the region and within individual countries,\\u201d with a \\nfocus on helping Southeast Asian countries escape the \\u201cmiddle-income trap.\\u201d Several \\nmonths later, in May 2015, Abe announced the creation of the Partnership for Quality \\nInfrastructure as part of the broader overhaul of Japan\\u2019s development policy. Japan \\nwould increase its investment in Asian infrastructure to JPY 13.2tn between 2016 and \\n2020, a 30% increase over the previous five-year period, with the funds divided \\nbetween the ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Japan \\nBank for International Cooperation\\u2019s (JBIC) infrastructure investment program, the \\nJapan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corporation for Transport & Urban \\nDevelopment (JOIN). To encourage private investment, JBIC would relax its conditions \\nrequiring host governments to offer guarantees of their ability to repay loans and instead \\noffer to cover losses incurred by private investors. JICA would streamline the process of \\ndispensing loans and grants and would work closely with the ADB to foster public-\\nprivate partnerships (PPP). JICA and the ADB would establish a fund to enable them to \\nmake equity investments in support of infrastructure investment. Recognizing that Asia\\u2019s \\ninfrastructure needs are substantial, he argued, \\u201cWe should seek \\u2018quality as well as \\nquantity.\\u2019  Pursuing both ambitiously is perfectly suited to Asia.\\u201d23 This program was \\nclearly intended as Japan\\u2019s response to the then-nascent BRI and AIIB. \\n\\nThe Abe government would further refine its infrastructure export strategy in 2016, when, \\nin conjunction with its hosting of the G7 in May 2016, it unveiled the \\u201cHigh-Quality \\nInfrastructure Export Expansion Initiative,\\u201d which included new capital for Japan\\u2019s public \\nfinancial institutions that would, from 2017 onwards, increase annual support for \\ninfrastructure exports to JPY 200bn annually from JPY 110bn, sharply reduce the time \\nrequired to secure a yen-denominated international loan, explore euro-denominated \\nlending, and increase NEXI\\u2019s insurance coverage for overseas projects to 100%.24 \\n\\nSeen from this perspective, the pending decision to participate in the BRI appears to be \\nsimply a new component of a wider-reaching strategy rather than a new strategy in and \\nof itself. Limited participation in the BRI may present Japan with new opportunities for \\nboth meeting its development goals by helping to close Asia\\u2019s infrastructure gap and for \\n\\n170Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nmeeting its infrastructure export target. Indeed, even as Japan has moved closer to \\nembracing the BRI, it has deepened its partnership with India to promote its own \\ninfrastructure initiative, the AAGC. The Abe government has not only engaged India as \\na partner for advancing \\u201cquality\\u201d infrastructure in Asia and neighboring regions, it has \\nalso taken advantage of India\\u2019s decision to not join the BRI to ramp up its own \\ndevelopment assistance, complementing the broader strategic engagement between \\nthe Abe and Modi governments. The joint statement from Abe\\u2019s September 2017 visit to \\nIndia includes a laundry list of Japanese aid and investment projects in India, including \\ninfrastructure development in India\\u2019s North Eastern Region (which, coming in the wake \\nof the military confrontation between India and China at Doklam, was opposed by \\nChina25); major rail investments, including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail and \\na JICA-sponsored technical assistance program for the National High Speed Rail \\nCorporation; subway projects in six major cities; and energy, sanitation, and \\u201csmart city\\u201d \\ncooperation.26 As noted previously, as of 2015 India was already the largest recipient of \\nJapanese ODA, and the latest bilateral exchanges suggest that India will continue to \\ngrow as both a partner and recipient of public development assistance and private \\ninvestment from Japan. The deepening of the Japan-India partnership puts Japan\\u2019s \\napproach to the BRI in perspective. In much the same way Japan has pursued TPP as \\nan alternative vision for the regional trading regime, Japan has pursued its own vision of \\nregional development. Even if Japan seeks areas of cooperation with China, strategic \\ncompetition between the two countries will lead Japan to keep China-led initiatives at an \\narm\\u2019s length and will lead it to pursue its own vision for regional development even if it \\ncannot match China in terms of funding. \\n\\nComparison: Australia and the BRI\\n\\nJapan\\u2019s evolving approach to regional development and the BRI contrasts in important \\nways with Australia, another Asian developed country with a complex, interdependent \\neconomic relationship and an often-contentious political and security relationship with \\nChina. Like Japan, Australia recognizes Asia\\u2019s needs for infrastructure and has also \\nstressed the importance of \\u201chigh-quality\\u201d infrastructure that \\u201chas robust social and \\nenvironmental safeguards and avoids unsustainable debt burdens on the economies of \\nthe region.\\u201d27 Unlike Japan, however, Australia has struggled to chart an independent \\npath that balances cooperation with China and pursuit of its own development strategy. \\nIt may belatedly be reaching a similar policy mix as Japan has articulated. \\n\\nTo a certain extent, however, Australia and Japan are moving in opposite directions. \\nWhereas Japan opposed the AIIB and refused to consider BRI participation before 2017, \\nAustralia concluded a free trade agreement with China in 2014, was a founding member \\nof the AIIB in 2015, and, according to Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye, entered \\ndiscussions with China in 2015 and 2016 regarding how China and Australia could \\ncooperate under the auspices of the BRI, including a possible linkage to Canberra\\u2019s \\nplan for developing Northern Australia. 28 However, ahead of a March 2017 visit to \\nAustralia by Premier Li Keqiang, the Turnbull government abandoned talks regarding a \\nmemorandum of understanding for a BRI-Northern Australia linkage.29 In short, even as \\nJapan was preparing to discuss how to cooperate with the BRI, Australia was rejecting \\n\\n171Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nChinese overtures to extend the initiative to Australia itself. Australia has not \\ncategorically rejected the BRI; Trade Minister Steven Ciobo attended the Belt and Road \\nForum in May 2017, for example, on which occasion he said, \\u201cAustralia supports the \\naims of initiatives such as Belt and Road that improve infrastructure development and \\nincrease investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.\\u201d30 \\n\\nAs with Japan, Australia\\u2019s approach to the BRI has been strongly shaped by domestic \\npolitics. In Australia\\u2019s case, despite signals from Canberra that it is willing to work with \\nChina on infrastructure investment across Asia, Australia has been in the midst of a \\n\\u201cpanic\\u201d about the Chinese government\\u2019s influence in Australia following reports about \\n\\u201cthought policing\\u201d of Chinese students at Australian universities and the resignation of \\nopposition Senator Sam Dastyari after it emerged that he appeared to have accepted \\nChinese donations in exchange for defending Beijing\\u2019s positions, particularly on the \\nSouth China Sea.31 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull himself escalated tensions with \\nChina when, speaking in Mandarin, he evoked Mao Zedong by saying \\u201cthe Australian \\npeople stand up\\u201d in response to perceived Chinese influence operations. 32  In this \\ncontext, it may be difficult for the Turnbull government to bolster cooperation with China \\non infrastructure investment or extending the BRI to Australia proper. In fact, since the \\nstart of 2018, Canberra has feuded with Beijing over its development policies after \\nMinister for International Development and the Pacific Concetta Fierravanti-Wells \\ncriticized China for funding \\u201cuseless buildings\\u201d in the South Pacific,33 prompting the \\nChinese government to oppose Canberra\\u2019s \\u201cirresponsible remarks.\\u201d34 In this context, it \\nmay be difficult if not impossible for Australia to move beyond what Australian scholar \\nIan Hall calls Australia\\u2019s \\u201cwait-and-see\\u201d BRI strategy.35 \\n\\nAt the same time, Australia is struggling to articulate an independent development \\nstrategy. While it has enthusiastically embraced the TPP-11 alongside Japan, the \\nAustralian government has continued to cut ODA budgets and has yet to articulate new \\npolicies to leverage private-sector investment. This may be beginning to change: in \\nDecember the Turnbull government issued a report highlighting opportunities for \\ninfrastructure investment in the Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)36 and \\nthe revival of the \\u201cquad\\u201d of Australia, the US, Japan, and India could create new \\nopportunities for economic cooperation. Nevertheless, even as Japan has responded to \\nChina by revamping its development institutions, promoting private investment, and \\npursuing new relationships to promote regional development before seeking to \\ncooperate with the BRI, Australia has struggled, failing either to reach an \\naccommodation with the BRI or to develop a new strategy for competing with China. \\n\\nBy comparing how Japan and Australia have responded to the BRI, there are two \\ntakeaways. The first is that domestic politics matters. Part of the reason Japan is only \\nnow pursuing a role in the BRI is that the Japanese public is not nearly as hostile \\ntowards China as it was after the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute intensified after 2012. \\nSimilarly, the uptick in fear and hostility in Australia towards China\\u2019s presence in \\nAustralia has made it difficult for Canberra to take a consistent position towards the BRI. \\nSecond, although Japan has argued for \\u201cquality\\u201d infrastructure investment, it has \\nrecognized that it cannot counter China without spending some money. While Japan\\u2019s \\n\\n172Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nODA budget has not necessarily grown, as mentioned previously the Abe government \\nhas channeled more funds to its overseas investment institutions and made it easier for \\nthem to lend. By contrast, the recent spat between Australia and China over China\\u2019s aid \\nin the South Pacific has highlighted the extent to which Australia has cut its ODA \\nbudgets.37 \\n\\nImplications for the United States\\n\\nThe massive investment surge promised by the BRI has highlighted longstanding \\nconcerns about the risks of economic interdependence with China; with Chinese funds, \\nanalysts argue, will come Chinese influence over a recipient\\u2019s foreign and domestic \\npolicies. As the recent uproar in Australia shows, these concerns are not limited to \\ndeveloping countries \\u2013 and they are not new concerns.38 \\n\\nHowever, Japan\\u2019s management of its relationship with China and its cautious embrace \\nof the BRI is instructive. While we do not yet know what form Japanese cooperation with \\nthe BRI will eventually take or what effects it could have on Japan domestically, the Abe \\ngovernment\\u2019s approach offers some lessons. \\n\\nFirst, the Japanese government\\u2019s shift on the BRI rests on an essential fact. With the \\nBRI added to the Chinese Communist Party\\u2019s constitution at the nineteenth Party \\nCongress, there is no question that the BRI will remain central to China\\u2019s foreign policy \\nfor at least as long as Xi is in charge. Whether or not third countries decide to cooperate \\nwith China through the BRI, China will continue to use it to strengthen its trade and \\ninvestment links across Eurasia and the rest of the developing world. Developed \\ncountries like Japan and Australia have the choice to stay out of the initiative \\u2013 and are \\nobviously less dependent on Chinese investment than the less developed and \\ndeveloping countries most in need of infrastructure \\u2013 but staying out will have costs, \\nwhether in terms of lost opportunities for one\\u2019s businesses or lost influence in BRI \\npartner countries. \\n\\nIf the BRI will be a fixture in Asia\\u2019s economics and politics, the developed democracies, \\nespecially the maritime democracies in Asia, need to have their own plans for how to \\npromote development in Asia, particularly in the middle-income countries of ASEAN. As \\nimportant as strengthening security ties with allies and partners around East Asia is for \\nthe United States, Japan, and Australia, security cooperation will not be sufficient to win \\n\\u201chearts and minds\\u201d in the region over the long term. Obviously, China\\u2019s rise is divisive \\nthroughout the region and countries can be attracted to China\\u2019s economic power while \\nstill being concerned about its military power. In fact, for many of China\\u2019s neighbors its \\neconomic power is a source of anxiety too. In a 2017 Pew survey of attitudes towards \\nChina across the region, only 26% of Vietnamese, 49% of Indonesians, 48% of Filipinos, \\nand 20% of Indians said that China\\u2019s growing economy was a good thing for their \\ncountry. Ironically, Australians were the most positive about the benefits of China\\u2019s \\ngrowth: 70% said it was good for Australia. In all of these countries, majorities (and a \\nplurality in Indonesia) said China\\u2019s growing military power was a bad for their \\ncountries.39 These attitudes present an opportunity to the US and its allies to present an \\n\\n173Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nalternative vision for the region. But, over time, as China ramps up its investment \\nthrough BRI, it could wield influence through a variety of channels, complicating efforts \\nby the US and its allies to win support for their own initiatives in the region.40 As the US \\ncompetes for influence in Asia, it cannot assume that fears of China\\u2019s military power will \\nbe sufficient to preserve its influence. As Japan has shown, the best way for the US and \\nits partners to challenge China\\u2019s growing influence is to offer an alternative. As Japan\\u2019s \\nengagement in India has shown, by committing resources and pursuing its own \\ndevelopment strategy, Japan has lowered the costs to India of staying out of the BRI. \\nPerhaps India will not be able to stay out of the BRI forever, but Japan\\u2019s ODA and \\ngrowing investment portfolio will increase India\\u2019s freedom of action if and when it does. \\nThe same holds true in other countries on China\\u2019s periphery. Their fears of dependence \\non China give the US and its allies an opening, but as Japan shows, it is necessary to \\nhave something tangible to offer them. \\n\\nThis need is even more profound now that the US has withdrawn from TPP and the \\nadministration has not yet articulated a new strategy to deepen engagement with \\nmiddle-income Asia. As noted previously, TPP offered Asia\\u2019s developing countries new \\nmarket opportunities in the US in exchange for reforming their economies in ways that \\nbenefited US companies. As the Obama administration emphasized and as the Abe \\nadministration has continued to stress, TPP also provided the region with an alternative \\nsets of rules that could force China to adapt, instead of pushing its own version of the \\nrules governing trade and investment in Asia through the BRI. While Japan\\u2019s bid to \\nrevive TPP may preserve some of its benefits as an alternative vision for regional \\neconomic integration, the absence of the US limits its attractiveness to the developing \\ncountries that were otherwise eager to join. Without a regional trade strategy aimed at \\nmiddle-income Asia, it is imperative for the US to develop a regional development \\nstrategy that uses bilateral foreign aid, cooperation with the ADB and other multilateral \\nlending institutions, and, perhaps most importantly, incentives to encourage private \\ninfrastructure investment in South and Southeast Asia. Given Japan\\u2019s existing \\ncapabilities and influence, the US should coordinate closely with Japan and follow \\nTokyo\\u2019s lead in stressing the importance of high-quality infrastructure. Developing a joint \\nregional development strategy could be an appropriate agenda item for the US-Japan \\nEconomic Dialogue, as well as for future meetings of the quad. \\n\\nDespite China\\u2019s determination to use its wealth to promote greater economic ties to \\nChina across Eurasia and expand its power and influence, it is not inevitable that China \\nwill succeed in binding its neighbors ever closer. But the US and its allies cannot beat \\nsomething with nothing. If they want to support the development of Asia and ensure \\nthat, even as the region develops, its growth is fiscally, environmentally, and socially \\nsustainable, it is imperative that they coordinate and develop their own plans for \\nmeeting Asia\\u2019s developmental needs, giving the countries of South and Southeast Asia \\nmore freedom of action even as Chinese investment proceeds.  \\n\\n174Back to Table of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Michael Camdessus, \\u201cWhy China\\u2019s belt and road must be a pathway to sustainable development,\\u201d \\nSouth China Morning Post, 17 May 2017. <http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-\\nopinion/article/2094611/why-chinas-belt-and-road-must-be-pathway-sustainable>. \\n2 Jiji Press, 24 December 2017. <https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2017122400239>.

Thank you all. \\nI'm glad I had lunch; right?  It's got us revved up.  Whoo.  Yes.  So to my fellow \\n\\ncommissioners, first hearing from Commissioner Stivers, please. \\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Sure.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you all for \\n\\nthose excellent testimonies. \\nLet's, if we could, start with South Asia and India.  As you mentioned, you know, \\n\\nChina didn't invent connectivity.  It's been going on for a long time, and there's been numerous \\ninitiatives to connect especially South Asia, which is one of the least connected regions of the \\nworld.  I mean India is not even connected to itself, much less its neighbors in South Asia, much \\nless to Afghanistan, and much less to Central Asia. \\n\\nAnd there's been numerous initiatives to try to improve connectivity from India's \\nstandpoint and kind of get Afghanistan, in particular, and Central Asia better access to the \\nmarkets in both Pakistan and India, and that was a major initiative of the last administration, \\nwhich was called the New Silk Road before China called it the New Silk Road. \\n\\nBut my question is this: should the U.S. be going down that road in terms of \\nhelping India better connect to South Asia?  And is that a competition for what the Chinese are \\ndoing in terms of connecting to everywhere pretty much?  And how receptive is India to that?  \\nHow much are they doing?  And how can we help India? \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Sure.  So I mean I think, as you point out, because there is such a \\nsignificant deficit already there in terms of connectivity, I think there is really significant \\ncapacity to pursue complementary initiatives in the region that don't just function as competition.  \\nThe needs are very significant as you point out.  A number of them are--there's even more needs \\ninside India itself.  A lot of the Japanese initiatives are internal to India. \\n\\nThere's significant deficits there.  So I mean I think it's possible to do this in a \\nmanner that doesn't, isn't wasteful, doesn't simply heighten the geopolitical competition with \\nChina and the region if it's pursued effectively. \\n\\nI mean I think the Japanese model is still, to me, the kind of gold standard on all \\nof this in several respects.  There's real money behind it.  It's got significant private sector \\ninvolvement and buy-in.  It's differentiated clearly--the Quality Infrastructure Initiative.  \\n\\nIt dovetails very closely with the political agenda that India has in the region.  But \\nit also involves a kind of conditional offer of partnership with China on very specific terms that \\nhave just been laid out before, just in December, in terms of the sorts of projects that Japan is \\nwilling to work with China on under the BRI. \\n\\nSo I think that's the kind of zone that one has to get into.  And, of course, the \\nother thing is there's a serious trade agenda there, and that's a piece where, of course, India lags \\nin terms of its own enthusiasm for involvement in high-standard trade agreements and things like \\nthat. \\n\\nAnd I think that is an area where it would be helpful if India could be drawn in \\nmore effectively to those sorts of frameworks that Japan has been pushing very effectively in the \\nlast period of time. \\n\\nSo I think those would be the main areas. Some of them are internal.  Some of \\nthem are some of the Southeast Asia connectivity.  A lot of these are kind of East-West where \\nsome of the China pieces are North-South.  Some of it is being able to develop non-China-centric \\nmodels.  India has a number of plans, including again cooperation with some of the Southeast \\n\\n177\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nAsian states, with Japan and others, and finally I mean one of the biggest problems remains the \\nIndia-Pakistan piece on this when it comes to transit trade in the region, access to Afghanistan.  \\n\\nIt's possible to construct things around it, and Chabahar and these things have.  \\nBut in the end being able to ensure that there is an environment in South Asia where rivals are \\nalso able to trade and benefit from economic linkages with each other will be helpful, and I think \\nin the end that's something that the U.S. will also have to play a role in facilitating and has tried \\nto, of course, in the past. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  I mean it just seems to me connectivity is not a \\nzero-sum game. \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Exactly. \\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  I mean you have, you know, Belt and Road \\n\\nInitiative.  It's going to move forward.  No one is going to stop it.  It's going to do what it's going \\nto do.  But a robust India connectivity initiative could, you know, obviously do a lot for the \\neconomies in the region, and whether Japan will lead that or whether the Quad can come \\ntogether and work on that sort of thing. \\n\\nBut it would be a balance for the region in terms of connectivity to two of the \\nlargest markets that might make more sense in terms of stability and prosperity for the region.  \\n\\nJust real quick to Asian Development Bank. Asian Development Bank has been \\nthe multilateral institution.  They do projects in China, in India, all over Asia.  That would seem \\nto me, it would seem to me that the ADB is the institution that is kind of being relegated to the \\nsecond choice based on all these bilateral development initiatives. \\n\\nAnd I guess my question is what is Japan's view of the ADB?  I mean from my \\nperspective, it looks like it's being supplanted, and what can we do to strengthen the role of \\nADB?  What can the U.S. do in particular? \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  So I think, I think Japan has found itself in an uncomfortable \\nposition certainly when AIIB came on the scene, and one of the questions was how do we protect \\nthis institution that's been kind of our, you know, we've led, we've supported?  It's been one of \\nour vehicles for pursuing development in the region.  I mean but Japan itself has always pursued \\nbilateral development assistance as well. \\n\\nSo the ADB is certainly part of the portfolio.  And, look, at this point, it's \\ncertainly in a better position I think to fund a lot of these projects than the AIIB.  The bank itself \\nhas, I think, indicated that it is fully willing to work with the AIIB.  Look, they, you know, ten \\nyears ago identified the infrastructure gap that middle-income Asia was going to face that needed \\nto be filled.  So there--I mean they're obviously at a place where they can lend and support high-\\nquality infrastructure in a way that the AIIB is not ready to do yet. \\n\\nSo I mean I don't think there's quite as much concern at this point about whether \\nit's being sidelined.  I mean I think there is so much out there that needs to be funded that I mean \\nthey're--they're at the table.  Japan, I think, upped its amount.  One of its initiatives over the last \\nseveral years is increasing its funding with ADB. \\n\\nSo I don't think there's a worry necessarily about it being supplanted.  You know, \\nI think making sure that the United States continues to meet its commitments, the ADB is \\nimportant, and, you know, supporting that emphasis on high-quality infrastructure is a way to \\nmake sure that this alternate vision, I think, continues to move forward and really becomes \\nreality.  So I think that really just making sure the U.S. is an active participant in the ADB is \\nessential. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Just one quick follow-up.  Have you seen any \\n\\n178\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nlessening of standards by the ADB in order to--I worry about a race to the bottom in terms of \\nstandards in Asia because of the Belt and Road Initiative.  Have you seen any of that, Mr. Harris \\nor Mr. Eisenman, Dr. Eisenman? \\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  Well, I was just going to associate myself with these remarks.  \\nIt seems to me that there's enough to go around when it comes to infrastructure construction, and \\nthat in a lot of ways the ADB is setting the standard, and it can set high standards, as Mr. Small \\nsaid a moment ago. \\n\\nAnd it's in setting those high standards that it can, in fact, in fact, benefit maybe \\nfrom the competition with the AIIB, right, that the AIIB is competing with it and thus making it \\nraise its standards in order to--and raise the amount of funds. \\n\\nSo it's got more funds and higher standards in a way that is actually facilitating \\nand enhancing it through competition.  So I don't--I agree with the initial statement you made.  I \\ndon't see it as a zero-sum game.  And the AIIB, to my understanding, hasn't really done anything \\nyet. \\n\\nSo having done almost nothing and being in Beijing, and Beijing, to my \\nunderstanding, and, friends, you can tell me if I'm wrong, is the AIIB the only institution in \\nBeijing that's not controlled by the Communist Party of China and is not a foreign embassy; \\nright? \\n\\nSo it's physically in a tough location politically, if that makes sense; right?  \\nWhereas, the ADB doesn't face this kind of problem.  So I'm not sure that that is hampering it or \\nif other issues are hampering it, but it's certainly the general environment with which the \\norganization exists. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Thank you. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Okay.  Senator Talent, please. \\nCOMMISSIONER TALENT:  Thank you. \\nMr. Small, I'm very interested in your discussion of India.  You said that the \\n\\nChinese took care with the Japanese and the Russians to lay the basis for all of this and didn't \\nwith India. \\n\\nAnd then you said India was successful, I think if I understood you correctly, in \\nimposing some red lines in South Asia.  So could you and the others please chime in?  Flesh that \\nout a little bit.  Why do you think the Chinese didn't prepare the ground with India?  What's the \\nsignificance in terms of what it says about Chinese-Indian competition?  And how was India able \\nto impose those red lines, as you put it? \\n\\nAnd then anybody else who wants to chime in on that. \\nMR. SMALL:  Thank you, Senator.  \\nSo the first element of this was, of course, China has a much better relationship \\n\\nwith Russia than it has with India.  There are other tensions there, but I don't think that was \\nactually the nub of it.  I think the nub of it was that China has not been ready, and I think it may \\nnow be prompted to take account in a serious way of India's sense of South Asia being its \\nbackyard, and that I think what India has showed in the last period of time, partly with the red \\nlines which we can go into, partly with what played out on the border, is that China is going to \\nhave to negotiate terms with India, that India has the capacity to influence China's-- \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER TALENT:  So if I could jump in, do you think they thought \\nthat the Indians would just give way?  They didn't think that they would effectively stand up for \\ntheir interests? \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  I think they thought they've been able to make a lot of the \\n\\n179\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nadvances that they've made in the last period of time without very much resistance, and then they \\nmoved ahead with some of these initiatives with Pakistan, that they felt they'd been able to kind \\nof shift some parameters there.  There were things that they used to be careful about.  They were \\nquite careful about Gwadar.  They were quite careful about the kinds of investments they had. \\n\\nAnd then they really started amping it up with CPEC, and they kind of tried--they \\nactually tried to pursue a slightly de-hyphenated approach to the two countries.  It doesn't work \\nin the region.  The Chinese relationship with Pakistan is something that India sees in various \\nways as a critical security concern, and they just didn't do--that they hadn't done economically \\nwith Pakistan what they had been doing before.  India--they went to the Indians and said, oh, this \\nwill be helpful to you.  This will stabilize Pakistan.  This will deal with de-radicalization things.  \\nIndia completely understandably sees the relationship through a security prism and wasn't buying \\nit. \\n\\nAnd I mean some describe China as having strategic contempt for India.  They \\ndon't take its concerns seriously enough.  I think what's played out in the last couple of years has \\nbeen a significant corrective to that.  India has political influence, it has military influence, even \\nif it doesn't have the same resources that it can bring to bear financially and economically. \\n\\nThe two cases that I mentioned, and I mean you could see the same thing with the \\nMaldives.  You could see, I mean India, even if it doesn't do a dollar for dollar matching can \\nshape these countries' choices, and I think China understands that better.  And the countries in \\nthe region understand that better. \\n\\nI very much doubt there will be another dual-use port for China in South Asia.  I \\nthink they will have their run of the Pakistani ports.  I don't think they'll have a dedicated naval \\nbase or something.  I don't think elsewhere in the region they will, they will end up with that \\noption because I think India will prevent it. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER TALENT:  Well, I just find that very interesting, and the \\nothers may want to come in, because it suggests that where there's an effective push back that the \\nChinese will substantively change their methods and perhaps their objectives, which might be a \\nclue for American policy. \\n\\nDoes anybody else want to chime in? \\nDR. EISENMAN:  I was just going to agree with what you said, Senator.  So in \\n\\nthe Chinese strategic thinking, and much has been written about this, there's a concept called the \\n\\\"shi,\\\" or the propensity of things; right?  And so if the propensity of things is in your favor, then \\nyou take a particular policy, it's likely to be successful.  But if the propensity of things is against \\nyou, even the best thought-out plan is not likely to be successful. \\n\\nSo I think that that's exactly right.  You know, the Chinese, the sense of it is very \\nopportunistic.  And so where you find push back, then you move around that push back.  And so \\nto that extent, you can, as a foreign power, benefit from that understanding, but it requires clearly \\ndefining your interests; right?   \\n\\nMy friend, Ambassador Derek Mitchell, has an analogy he likes to think about in \\nterms of basketball.  When you're standing and somebody hits you, the foul is on them.  When \\nyour feet are moving and you're all over the place, the foul is on you. \\n\\nAnd so to the extent that we can have a policy that's clear, I think that that's \\nperhaps the most important thing of all is that our policy is clear and supportive of our allies.  \\n\\nYou know this, this road that the CPEC corridor, it's going through this territory \\nwhich is claimed by India; right?  So it seems that, you know, I don't whether it's a strategic \\ncontempt or just contempt or just not thinking it through, but it seems that if you're going to drive \\n\\n180\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nthe road through territory that India claims--whether it's theirs or not, I'm not even getting into \\nthat--it seems like you're almost precluding them from participation; right? \\n\\nThey'd almost have to change their national policy of territorial integrity to join \\nyour One Belt One Road.  So I don't know if it's through contempt, neglect, or maybe purposeful \\nexclusion; right?  Or I don't know.  Maybe the geography means you can only drive it through \\nthat area.  But it seems to me that the minute you go through that contested area, you make it \\nimpossible for India to really be an important participant. \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  So I think one thing to add, and I wonder if Beijing was taken \\naback, the extent to which Abe and Modi have cemented a development partnership, you know?  \\nYou look at the wish, you know, the laundry list of projects that Japan and India agreed on when \\nPrime Minister Abe went to India in September, and it was, you know, he went to Prime Minister \\nModi's home province and was, you know, a giant celebration. \\n\\nI mean it was this lengthy list of not just, not just, you know, the big ticket \\nprojects about the high-speed rail corridor and the subways. I mean you obviously have those big \\nprojects.  But so much of what they're doing now is how do you get Japanese companies that are \\nnow increasingly diversifying their locations in Asia, and, you know, for the last, for the better \\npart of this decade, you've heard about the China Plus One.  Well, now, India, I think, is on the \\nradar screen for a lot of Japanese companies provided that you can get some of this infrastructure \\nand connectivity in place because I think right now a lot of them look at it and say, you know, \\nmaybe, but we need, you know, we need to actually be able to use this. \\n\\nAnd so you look at that laundry list, and so much of it is how do we get Japanese \\nmoney here? How do we get Japanese companies as partners?  And, you know, a lot of that is \\njust Japanese, you know, these public financial institutions providing sort of the floor to help the \\nJapanese companies enter the market.  I mean, but it's a slam dunk.  I mean you look at how \\nmuch Japan has leaped on this opportunity, and you wonder if that is pushback in its own way, \\nthat, okay, Japan saw the opportunity and has leveraged the relationship that Abe has with Modi, \\nand Abe has a longstanding interest in India, and they're running with it. \\n\\nAnd that I think now, you know, certainly is wrong for China, and I think that's \\ngot to be a factor as well. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Thank you. \\nCommissioner Shea, please. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Sure.  Well, thank you very much. \\nI guess my first question is for Mr. Small and then I have a question for Dr. \\n\\nEisenman.  I'm sorry, Mr. Harris.  Maybe I'll come up with one later. \\n[Laughter.] \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  But for Mr. Small, one of the things we learned \\n\\nthis morning or heard this morning was that China has learned as a result of its significant global \\ninvestments maybe to localize security.  So my understanding is that in Pakistan, China is relying \\non a 12,000 strong Pakistan security force.  Part of the projects go, are in Balochistan, which is a \\nvery tenuous area of Pakistan. \\n\\nI was wondering if you could just give us a briefing on how the security, the local \\nsecurities is doing there? \\n\\nAnd then, Dr. Eisenman, another thing I thought the Chinese learned from their \\nglobal investments was that they can't just bring in all this labor, Chinese labor.  They have to \\nsort of integrate local workers into their projects. \\n\\nBut then you said that one of their objectives is to deploy their--of the Belt and \\n\\n181\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nRoad Initiative--is to deploy their excess labor.  So I was wondering if you could, if you could \\nflesh that point out a little bit?  And what, do they have a number associated with their excess \\nlabor?  We have, you know, 30 million excess laborers that we need to deploy?  I mean what, if \\nthere is such a number, I'd be curious to hear that.  \\n\\nMr. Small. \\nMR. SMALL:  So thank you, commissioner. \\nYou're correct in China has the Pakistani army or its kind of inter-services \\n\\nprotection force that's been put in place.  The numbers could go substantially higher even than \\n12,000.  It's basically just guided by the scale of the projects that are there. \\n\\nThere's a Maritime Protection Task Force as well operating in the vicinity of \\nGwadar.  Basically mobile.  And this is added to a lot of the protection measures that have been \\nput in place after some of the incidents that took place back in 2007, 2008, around that sort of \\ntime. \\n\\nThey've actually done a relatively good job of securing Chinese personnel since \\nthat time. There was a period of time in which there were a number of kidnappings, killings of \\nChinese workers. In the period since then with these sort of stronger protection measures that \\nhave been put in place, you haven't--you've had near misses in Karachi.  You've had the kind of \\nbombing incident and things.  You haven't had Chinese workers working on these kind of \\ndedicated projects kidnapped or killed. \\n\\nThere is a current potential exception.  There was an engineer that disappeared in \\nKahuta, which could be the first kidnapping case, which should be rather sensitive. \\n\\nThe interesting thing is the greater concern is actually not the protection afforded \\nto the projects themselves.  It's the other Chinese that are coming into the country as a result of \\nthis and are operating outside this protection umbrella.  The case of the missionaries that were \\nkilled, kidnapped and killed in Quetta, for instance, and all of the incidents, in fact, that have \\ntaken place.  An academic, a cyclist that was riding through Pakistan to try to go to Iran and got \\npicked up. \\n\\nThe biggest headache is actually as much all of these other personnel who are \\nfloating around the country, and I think that's actually some of these countries, including \\nPakistan, can put in place really elaborate protocols.  I mean people can be transported in \\narmored personnel carriers to projects and things, but some of these softer targets are going to be \\na bigger headache. \\n\\nThere is an influx of Chinese personnel coming to these countries, and it still, of \\ncourse, causes a significant tension between the governments when it comes to recovery efforts \\nfor kidnapped victims and all of these sorts of cases. But I think more of them will come from \\nthose cases than successful attacks on projects themselves where I think the Pakistanis have \\nactually done a relatively successful job.  There are Pakistanis who have been killed but not \\nChinese.   \\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  Well, thanks for an excellent question.   \\nBefore I get into it, I have a quick question.  How many, the CPEC corridor, do \\n\\nyou happen to know the percentage of Chinese versus Pakistani labor working on it?  Andrew?  \\nOkay.  Because my understanding is there is a significant contingent of Chinese as well working \\non it. \\n\\nSo a couple of points to this very important question.  One is in terms of total \\nexcess labor, we know China has about 30 million extra men, which is about the entire \\npopulation of Canada, and it has to find a way to employ these people; right?  Otherwise they \\n\\n182\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nbecome a stability risk. \\nAnd so the exact number of people that they're looking for jobs for, I don't know.  \\n\\nBut I know that it's in the millions.  And I know that this is in part the result of their one-child \\npolicy and other measures that they've taken for many decades. \\n\\nNow as I had mentioned during my oral testimony, BRI is at this point anyway \\nlargely domestic, and that means that employing these people within China is perfectly \\nlegitimate as long as they're employed and not causing social stability problems. \\n\\nSo in Henan Province where you--or Hunan Province--excuse me--where you \\nmay have had a slowdown of construction, now you've got more money going in, which means \\nmore people are being hired, which means that your concerns about unemployment within that \\nprovince are reduced. \\n\\nSo the labor issue doesn't necessarily have to be about bringing them outside of \\nthe country.  It can also through the BRI Initiative be done within the country.   \\n\\nIn terms of the external, I think the commissioner is correct, that there has been \\nsome push back in terms of having Chinese labor on the ground.  However, I would say in my \\ninvestigation from the book I worked on with Ambassador David Shinn on China, Africa, we \\nfound that local labor laws have a lot to do with what China does and does not do in particular \\ncountries, and this is not all that surprising. \\n\\nBut we found, for instance, in Sudan at the time where we did research that it was \\nvery hard to fire a worker.  And therefore the Chinese were more than happy to bring in their \\nown workers because if they hired Sudanese workers and fired them, they'd have to pay them \\nback pay, and it was a whole mess. \\n\\nBut in Ethiopia, you could hire and fire a worker three times a day.  There was \\nvery little limitation, and so they used the Ethiopian workers like tissues, to some degree; right?  \\nIf they didn't like one, they would move on and they'd hire another.  And so the local labor laws \\nhad a lot to do with this. \\n\\nIn other countries we were in, people would show us forms that say, see, we have \\nexactly to the man the right amount of Chinese labor, and by the way, here's my new Hummer; \\nright? \\n\\n[Laughter.] \\nDR. EISENMAN:  So it was a little questionable as to whether or not the law of \\n\\nthe country was being implemented.  I don't have any proof to say it wasn't except for the fact \\nthat it didn't feel right that it went to the person of the amount of Chinese labor. \\n\\nBut so I would say this is a question that has a lot to do with where the project is \\nbeing implemented.  If it's implemented within China, of course China labor is going to be used \\nentirely.  If it's outside of China, we have to look at the laws of that country and their ability to \\nimplement them. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Okay. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Thank you, sir. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR SHEA:  Thank you. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Okay.  Vice Chairman Bartholomew, please. \\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Thank you very much.   \\nAndrew, I just wanted to add one thing as you were talking about India, which is \\n\\ndemography, and that sort of as you look five, ten, 15 years down the road, 50 percent of India's \\npopulation is under the age of 25.  We know that China has demographic aging issues that \\nthey're going to deal with. \\n\\n183\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nSo I think factoring that into India's rise or India's ability to sustain itself in the \\nregion and beyond, I think is going to be an important thing.  You know that.  I just--we'll chalk \\nit up to the flu. \\n\\n[Laughter.] \\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  I just want to ask all of you the \\n\\nquestion, one of the questions that I asked earlier, which is from Beijing's perspective, what do \\nyou think constitutes success for BRI?  What are the markers do you think that they are looking \\nto to be able to decide that this is a successful initiative? \\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  Well, um--sorry, do you want to go? \\nMR. HARRIS:  No, go ahead. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  So as I said in my oral testimony, I would say that the BRI \\n\\nInitiative in order to be successful probably has four components.  One is economic.  Another is \\npolitical, cultural, and then strategic.  \\n\\nEconomics.  First, I mean deploying the excess capital, the excess labor, and then, \\nyou know, probably being repaid; right?  At the end of the day, these are loans, and if they're not \\nrepaid, it's hard to see the program as a success. Now, you could go and write off all these \\nloans, but at that point, the question would be why did you make them loans in the first place, \\nright, if they were going to be a giveaway? \\n\\nSo presumably you want to either get repaid or you want to get equity stakes for \\nyour loans.  Internationalization of the renminbi has been something that's been an ongoing \\npriority for Beijing, and then, as I said, politically you've got to be liked better at the end of the \\nday; right?  If you go through all of these troubles, all of this money, and at the end of the day \\nyou lose influence in these countries, it's hard to call it success.   \\n\\nAnd then strategically, building China as a metropole, as an essential part of \\nglobalization. All roads leading to China to some degree.  And enhancing China's role as a \\nleading country in the world, a major power, both in a reputational sense and an economic sense \\nand political influence sense. \\n\\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Mr. Harris. \\nMR. HARRIS:  I mean I would just add to that I think there's a key word that \\n\\nunderlies a lot of that, and that is legitimacy.  And I think that explains a lot of the dance between \\nBeijing and Tokyo now to find the terms that Tokyo might contribute in some way.  I think it \\nmight explain how China courted Australia quite intensively within the last several years to try to \\nget Australian buy-in and maybe even to have Chinese or Australian infrastructure projects as \\npart of the BRI, particularly in northern Australia. \\n\\nHaving Japan, having Australia say yes, this is a legitimate approach to \\naddressing a real Asian and global problem, this infrastructure gap, and just the challenge of \\ndevelopment, and Japan recognizes it, Australia recognizes it, and I think the creation of the \\nAIIB showed a similar pursuit of legitimacy, the courtship of developed countries and getting \\nthem to sign on and getting European countries and South Korea, and Japan, and trying to get all \\nthese countries to say, yes, China is putting a real serious answer to a problem that we all \\nrecognize and we recognize the solutions to it and we support it. \\n\\nI mean that, I think, is a major concern, and I think it underlies beyond getting a \\nreturn, beyond just the cold calculations of political influence.  I mean I think there is you're \\nrecognizing China's status, you know, that it has risen, it is now providing, you know, true \\nleadership in a concrete--literally a concrete sort of way.  And I think that's a big part of it. \\n\\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  Andrew. \\n\\n184\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Yes, just to add to that, I mean in the first phase, they had a real \\nproblem.  There weren't projects happening.  You had this great initiative and you didn't have \\nthings moving forward on the ground.  When you look at the early contours, and this is why I \\nhighlighted the Pakistan case in the way that I did, governments that were willing to shovel \\nprojects to the Chinese, allow the Chinese to come in on the kinds of terms for their companies \\nthat they want in a significant way, established a relatively privileged position and political \\nsalience that they might not otherwise have had. \\n\\nInitially I think they just wanted something to show for it, and so--and the second \\nelement in the very early phase was a kind of political consent.  It does actually matter to China \\nthat India didn't turn up to the forum.  They pushed really hard and they sent endless arrays of \\ndiplomats.  The ambassador in India still comes up with suggestions for renaming CPEC and \\nthings that get expunged from the record and things like that.  \\n\\nThey do actually want this to be acquiesced to by countries, and I think one of the \\npriorities through this first phase was buy-in just at the political level.  I think they consider \\nwhere they've got to with Russia a success.  I think they consider what's happened with Japan in \\nthe last period a success.  \\n\\nI think in some cases even if it's just nonresistance, that's okay.  I think in India's \\ncase they just wanted acquiescence to CPEC and things like that.  But I think that partly, in the \\nfirst phase, those were partly what they wanted.  I would just note, as well, I mean I would agree \\nwith everything that my fellow panelists have mentioned on this. \\n\\nThere are some very ambitious country specific objectives over the very long-\\nterm.  I mean again I look at what constitutes success in Pakistan.  There's this enormous array of \\nkind of stabilizing the country, building confidence, adjusting the mindset, deradicalization, \\nbuilding it as an economic hub.  The incentives for the various actors actually in the Chinese \\nsystem on this are not all the same, and so what constitutes success for some of the economic \\nactors in Pakistan is not necessarily the same as what constitutes success for the PLA. \\n\\nYou're going to come into collision at certain points when it comes to questions \\nlike do you write off debts to your friends as a sort of strategic example to other countries that \\nthere are benefits to being a close security partner?  Do you--and Pakistan is going to be I think a \\ncase study for this as well. \\n\\nThe banks, the financing institutions, will then run into moral hazard questions \\nand things like that.  There will be others at the political level who have different incentives.  At \\nthe moment, a lot of these objectives are aligned under this kind of amorphous glob of all of the \\nkind of BRI stuff.  There are going to be points, and I think you already see this in some \\ncountries, where what constitutes success starts to be differentiated and comes into collision. \\n\\nI don't think they've really worked out how to navigate that fully yet.  At the \\nmoment, it's just I think the overall political direction is there, and then people are just swinging \\nin.  Having been watching the Pakistan relationship for a long time, you suddenly have all these \\nnew actors come in with different interests who had never been involved before when it was just \\nthe PLA running the show and other powerful actors.  You know it's going to be difficult to \\nbreak ties between some of these groups. \\n\\nVICE CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW:  So I'm curious--this was kind of raised \\nalso--your point about legitimacy--Nad\\u00e8ge Rolland, of course, today talked about tributary states.  \\nOh, she's here.  But talked about tributary states.  I'm inclined, actually, frankly, I'm perhaps a \\nlittle bit more cynical than some other people in it.  It's a concept that I find makes perfect sense \\nwhen you look sort of at China's rise and displacing the United States and all of that. \\n\\n185\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nAnd so I find myself wondering how much, how much is legitimacy an issue or \\nhow much is just sort of sheer power politics?  I could put the word \\\"fear\\\" out there, but power \\npolitics.  So getting respect and being treated as a legitimate power is a little bit different than \\nknowing that you can throw your weight around if and when you need to in order to accomplish \\nwhat you think you want to be accomplishing. \\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  I would actually say that these two things come together quite \\nnicely; right? The tributary state system is a way to legitimize at that point the imperial \\ngovernment of China.  You kowtow to the emperor; you bring him your shabby gifts, and he \\ngives you silk and jade, and then that legitimizes the grandeur of the throne and the imperial \\nregime. \\n\\nAnd I was a part of an event in Kashgar not too long ago.  Not Kashgar--excuse \\nme--in Urumqi not too long ago which seemed neo-imperial in that sense; right?  Foreigners \\ncoming up one after another explaining why the BRI was going to save them, and the Chinese \\nsitting in their big red chairs, \\\"um, yes, yes.\\\"  So it did have this neo-imperial approach to it. \\n\\nBut I would also agree that legitimacy is part of the need for a neo-imperial \\napproach; right?  That these things are very much interwoven and connected in terms of \\nlegitimizing the government of China internationally; right?  The more countries that \\nacknowledge China, and this is the Taiwan issue as well, it's a legitimization of the Communist \\nParty's rule over China. \\n\\nThe more countries that show up to the BRI, the more that legitimize their \\ndevelopment- first approach, the more that accept their political rule.  So I would say that both \\nare right and actually very much overlapping of what you both said. \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  I mean I think just too, I mean I think legitimacy is important, and \\nI think we see it in precisely the cautiousness with which Japan has approached.  Because I think \\nif it were just about power politics, I mean I think Japan would say we want nothing to do with \\nthis, there's nothing for us to gain here, and I think, I think they've recognized that there is a \\ncertain amount of leverage that comes from saying, you know, Japan is out or Japan is in.  You \\nknow, Japan is a wealthy country.  Japan did this.  You know, in some ways China is following \\nJapan's footsteps in a lot of ways. \\n\\nJapan spent several decades after the war as it rebuilt, trying to build political \\ninfluence through connectivity, through building infrastructure, through creating opportunities \\nfor its companies.  I mean this is, in some ways this is a blueprint.  China is following a blueprint \\nthat Japan invented.  I mean obviously on a bigger scale, but this is something that Japan spent a \\nlot of decades doing.  \\n\\nAnd so I think, you know, probably Beijing, Beijing might be reluctant to admit \\nit, but, you know, getting Japan's kind of blessing in some capacity I think is actually important, \\nand also, you know, that it's an important U.S. ally, and so kind of prying, you know, even if it's, \\neven if Japan is finding its own uses for it, I think prying Japan away and saying, look, Japan \\nsaid this is okay, and it's allowing its companies to participate and it's putting its money in, that \\nmeans something beyond just simply we're bringing Japan into our orbit. \\n\\nBecause I don't think that's actually what's happening, but I think that Japan's \\ncurrency is something different.  And, you know, that, so that's precisely the kind of series of \\ninteractions at very senior levels over the course of 2017 where getting one line into a joint \\nstatement, where you look at the language kind of evolve between from July to November to \\nDecember, that you have these statements where Japan is sort of giving inch by inch, you know, \\ntrying to set, to say we're not, we're going to do this on our terms.  We're not just going to give \\n\\n186\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nyou want you want, and I think there it reinforces the extent to which legitimacy is important if \\nnot the only thing. \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  I think it's partly a decision that they will really have to make in \\nthe next period of time as to the relative priorities in this respect. \\n\\nI think they have tried to do everything together and have not, have, you know, \\nthey had debt-for-equity deals, looked for dual-use ports, given contracts on terms that are not \\nparticularly generous, not been transparent.  I mean they've looked to fulfil all of their objectives \\nsimultaneously, and I think they are running into legitimacy problems in some of these cases, \\nand they are in some cases running into certain forms of resistance.  And they don't want--as in \\nother fields as well--kind of, as it were, countervailing coalitions that will work against them and \\nundermine their efforts. \\n\\nSo I mean in some of the cases, it's just a practical response to what's going on.  I \\ndo think this was, as they envisaged it, the more kind of benign version of what they were doing, \\na soft way to advance their power position and interests over time in ways that countries would \\naccept.  I think they were surprised by the reaction of countries like India actually, as well.  I \\nthink this is one of the other reasons that they, that they kind of had some of these missteps.  \\n\\nI think they thought that money would talk and people would want to see the \\nbenefits of investment from China and things like that.  I think the reconceptualization of what's \\ngoing on for a lot of countries in rethinking what the economic ramifications are of certain kinds \\nof relationships with China is putting them in a trickier spot.  And if they make certain \\nadjustments in the next period of time, then there's a different sort of impact. \\n\\nI mean the AIIB, again, in Chinese context, the AIIB is the sort of gold standard \\nversion of what they've been doing with this in terms of relative degrees of transparency, \\nmultilateral complementarity with existing initiatives.  But they don't want the whole initiative to \\nlook like the AIIB.  They want to retain the prerogatives to do things bilaterally, do politically \\ntargeted efforts. \\n\\nBut they, in some of the cases, they're going to have to make some choices as to \\nwhat contours the initiative takes.  I think they got away in the first phase with a degree of \\nconfusion about the intentions and things.  In the next period of time, more and more projects \\nwill hit the ground, there will be more and more cases where you can actually assess multiple \\ninstances of things like debt renegotiations.   \\n\\nIs Hambantota a one-off, they've learned, seen as a kind of cautionary tale, or is \\nthis something that they start to replicate in other cases?  If it is, it's going to change the kinds of \\nresponses that countries have to it.  I don't think they've reached a decision yet.  I think there's \\nstill a lot of having cake and eating it with Belt and Road at the moment.  But I think it's going to \\nbe forced on them soon. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Okay.  I have got questions for Mr. Harris and \\nDr. Eisenman at the moment.  And first let me start with Japan.  I want to dig deeper into this.  I \\nwas delighted to read your testimony, and I was reminded, and as you laid out the facts of the \\namount of investment Japan has and some of the frameworks that they have, I was reminded of \\nour trip this last year to Thailand and to Myanmar where it was really clear what role Japan is \\nplaying in parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia. \\n\\nIn your testimony, Mr. Harris, you spoke about two things I'd like you to expand \\non.  First of all, you mentioned Japan and India announced the creation of Asia-Africa Growth \\nCorridor, and I'm wondering if you can expand on that. \\n\\nAnd then on the next page, page or two later, you spoke about Japan's free and \\n\\n187\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nopen Indo-Pacific strategy framework.  So could you give us for the record more details on both \\nof those?  And is Japan somewhat purposefully trying to play a little, not below the radar, but, \\nyou know, are they being wise to be not too confronting so that would be for you, Mr. Harris? \\n\\nAnd Dr. Eisenman, in your testimony, you spoke about, on page 14, that BRI \\nwould open new opportunities for fraud and corruption, and that many of these countries, which \\nwe all obviously know are rated poorly on corruption and transparency indexes.  Can you \\ncomment on the risks that you see for China in terms of money laundering and how that might be \\na factor as they--you mentioned how much debt, but, you know, it just seems like there are some \\nother risks? \\n\\nSo let's start with Mr. Harris, please. \\nMR. HARRIS:  Thank you for those questions and for closely reading my written \\n\\ntestimony.  I appreciate that. \\nSo on the first, I mean I think at this point, the Asia and Africa Growth Corridor \\n\\nwas announced as a vision in May of last year, and so we're looking at it.  It's not even a year old.  \\nI don't think they're at a point now that they're not, they're not starting on projects yet.  I think \\nthere's an idea, though, that it would rival some of the maritime dimensions of the BRI.  So that \\nit's connectivity between India, particularly I think--and this is something that I think got China \\nrather upset--that Japan is focusing particularly on India's northeast.   \\n\\nAnd I think the idea would be connectivity between northeastern India, Southeast \\nAsia, and then from Southeast Asia and the port structures in Southeast Asia, then build that out \\nto East Africa. And that really is the idea. \\n\\nBut I think they're at the point now where it's something they've laid out.  They're \\ncommitted to it.  It obviously is part of this broader high-quality infrastructure approach.  But I \\nthink this is something that we're going to have to watch going forward to see what actually this \\nends up looking like, what\\u2019s the timeline for getting these projects built. \\n\\nAnd I think really, as I've mentioned before, I think right now the main thing to \\nwatch between Japan and India is what Japan is doing within India, how Japan is filling India's \\nneeds for infrastructure now. \\n\\nAs much as we're seeing the cooperation in South and Southeast Asia more \\nbroadly, I think right now that Japan's role in India itself is, I think, the more important \\ndimension of their cooperation right now. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Okay. \\nMR. HARRIS:  As for the free and open Indo-Pacific strategy concept, this is \\n\\nsomething that has existed basically in some form in Japanese foreign policy thinking for at least \\na decade.  When Abe was first prime minister, towards the end of first year as prime minister in \\n2006 and 2007, took a trip to India, gave a speech in the Indian Parliament where he talked about \\nthe meeting of the two seas, and this is something that I think has been close to him for, you \\nknow, to his thinking for a long time, this idea of, you know, India, enlisting India as a partner as \\nthe region changes, as China's influence grows. \\n\\nAnd, you know, they would say that we're not trying to contain China, you know-\\n- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Yeah. \\nMR. HARRIS:  They're careful to say that that's not the goal, but drawing India \\n\\ninto the East Asian balance of power is I think something Japan is very interested in.  I mean \\nobviously they look at demographics and see India is a country that could be important and could \\nbe helpful for Japan. \\n\\n188\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nAnd obviously then growing out of that was this concept of the Quadrilateral, and \\nso you had in 2007 the first convening of that, that body that basically then went dormant for the \\nbetter part of the last decade and only really was revived in November of last year on the \\nsidelines of APEC. \\n\\nAnd so that is, I think, a concept now that has been revived, but again it's in \\nsearch of substance, you know, that, yes, military cooperation between Japan, Australia, India, \\nand the United States is, you know, there's plenty of experience there and working together and \\nexercises, and that I think is going to proceed. \\n\\nBut I think there's, it's a concept in want of real practical goals that they can \\nachieve, and I think this focus on high-quality infrastructure and articulating an alternative vision \\nof infrastructure investment in the region is something that they could all work on.  And, you \\nknow, with Japan's focus on it, with India getting in the game, Australia at least saying the right \\nthings if not quite getting there institutionally, there's plenty of material to work with. \\n\\nAnd so I think as the administration is and the U.S. Congress thinks about how to \\ngive more substance to this Indo-Pacific concept, I mean I think infrastructure should be a \\npriority for that discussion going forward. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Are you aware of whether or not the United States is--some of \\nour key leaders are thinking about this in terms of the framework itself?  Hooking in with it or I \\nmean what's the level of awareness here? \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  I think, I mean I think it's, I think there are discussions.  I don't \\nthink it's at the level of, you know, formal strategy documents yet, but I think, certainly I think in \\nthe administration and various departments, I think there's recognition that this is a--you know, \\nthis should be a priority, and that it could be done. \\n\\nAnd again the discussions, I think, in Congress about OPIC, OPIC going forward, \\nI think, are really important, having an institution that can contribute to these discussions, that's \\ngoing to be the counterpart to JBIC and to JICA, you know, the Japanese institutions that have \\nbeen doing for so long. \\n\\nAnd I think there has to be a recognition here that Japan is so much more-- \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Right. \\nMR. HARRIS:  --experienced.  They've been doing this for so many decades.  \\n\\nYou know, they're trusted.  I think the fact of going to Myanmar, going to Thailand, you know, \\nthat seeing the Japanese on the ground in all of these places in quite a substantial way and also, \\nyou know, the supply chains they have in all of these countries, you know, integrating these \\ncountries into Japan's system of production, Japan is going to have an edge here.  And there's no \\nreason why the United States can't follow Japan's lead and ask Japan, hey, what can we do to \\nhelp you?  You know, you've thought about this more, you have the resources, you have the \\nexperience; what can we do to support you? \\n\\nAnd I don't think there's any reason why the U.S. can't be in a position to ask that, \\nto offer that support. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Good.  Thank you. \\nDr. Eisenman.  Thank you by the way. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Oh, no.  Thank you.  Thank you again for taking the time to \\n\\nread my written testimony which is pretty long. \\n[Laughter.] \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Thank you. \\nFirst of all, I want to associate myself with the remarks just made.  I was really \\n\\n189\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nhappy to see the Quadrilateral meeting for the first time in a decade.  I think it's really essential \\nnot only on the economic side but on the political side; right? \\n\\nWe need the liberal leaders of the world to walk with their chests out a little bit.  \\nRight? Part of the problem is-- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  I like that. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  --we're being a little too modest, right.  We're not muscular \\n\\nliberals.  We're the other side, right.  So I'm pleased to see this. I'd like to see a more political \\naspect to it, not just security, and of course economics as well, but owning, to some degree, \\ndemocracy and being proponents of it. \\n\\nIn terms of your question, which is a good one, this issue of corruption, and as \\nthis body knows and I'm sure everyone in the room knows, Xi Jinping has been leading this anti-\\ncorruption campaign, and this is a signature campaign as much, if not more so maybe, than his \\nBRI campaign, and so the idea that BRI could then contribute to an enhanced corruption seems \\nantithetical to his objective-- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Right, right. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  --in that way.  And so this is where the nexus of your question \\n\\nis and becomes very interesting.  If you've got two signature campaigns, and one is doing \\ndamage to the other, then that would seem to be a problem. \\n\\nAnd there is to some degree the internal component.  Maybe Xi Jinping can exert \\ninfluence, more influence, right.  This is within China so what's going on in Hunan and other \\nplaces, it's \\\"gue ne.\\\"  It's internal and therefore China can to some degree utilize the tools of the \\nanti-corruption campaign.  That is these investigation squads, different internal Party \\nmechanisms to make sure that within China, the BRI is not or is less corrupt. \\n\\nBut externally when you're in all of these myriad of different 60-plus legal \\nenvironments, linguistic environments, cultural environments, things become much more dicey, \\nand my experience is mainly on the Africa side, and so maybe I can recount a quick anecdote. \\n\\nAmbassador Shinn and I were doing research in Angola.  We met with a minister \\nin Angola, and there was a Chinese gentleman in the room so I began talking to him in \\nMandarin, and I asked him what he was doing, and he said, well, I'm building this particular \\nproject, but before I can do it, I need to build a villa for this minister, and he wasn't pleased about \\nit, right?  That came out of his end, right?  And he rolled out the plans-- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Wow. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  --and showed me the bedrooms and everything.  But the point \\n\\nwas that it's not necessarily that the Chinese are wanting to be corrupt; it's to some degree the \\nenvironments that you work in when you work in the countries which have low transparency \\nindexes.  So I'm not trying to absolve anybody. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  No, I understand. \\nDR. EISENMAN:  Yeah.  But it's the nature to some degree of the environment, \\n\\nand the standard gauge railway in Kenya has come under a lot of criticism for the cost of the \\nendeavor.  And the question has been, and I don't know the answer, is how much of that is \\ncorruption? \\n\\nNow it's an expensive proposition to begin with, right?  The British lost a lot \\nbuilding their colonial railway.  But the question of whether or not corruption played a role in \\nthat is an issue as well.  And so again to go back to the answer to Commissioner Shea, a lot of \\nthis has to do with the local environments that they're operating in, and whether the authority-- \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Right. \\n\\n190\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nDR. EISENMAN:  --or the state is significant enough to check that issue. \\nOn the other side, however, in China, traditionally, there has been a corrupt \\n\\nmentality in terms of doing business, and so I've heard, for example, one tale in an African \\ncountry where the Chinese received a criticism for an environmental degradation.  The \\nAmericans received the same.  The Chinese paid off that official and then the official was moved \\nand the paper came back onto their desk. \\n\\nThe Americans said, okay, well, we'll pay you a percentage of it, and it went \\naway, and in the end, the Americans paid less to get rid of it, right?  So there is this kind of the \\nnature of doing business in China influences the way that Chinese businessmen behave abroad.  \\nThat shouldn't be surprising.  That's human nature. \\n\\nBut to the extent that China cleans up its act at home, we would expect to see, I \\nthink, less corruption abroad.  So the door can swing both ways.  If Xi is successful in his \\ncampaign, if he does wipe out corruption, we should expect to see less corruption in the BRI \\nInitiative than in past loans for infrastructure projects. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  I follow your logic, but I also think of the \\nvarious ports and the junctures and think about, I just worry about the terrorism, money-\\nlaundering piece.  Thank you. \\n\\nMr. Small, do you have comments on either the Japan conversation or on the \\nmoney laundering/terrorism component? \\n\\nMR. SMALL:  Just to add really on the administration piece, where the current \\nU.S. administration is at, I mean I think the striking thing is the last time the Quad was \\nconvening, it was essentially a security-focused discussion. \\n\\nThis time when you had the assistant secretary-level meeting taking place, late \\nlast year, a large proportion of the discussions were precisely focused on the strategic economic \\nissues. \\n\\nNow, as I think Dr. Kliman flagged in the discussions this morning, is the Quad \\nthe natural structure through which to have those, to implement some of these things?  Not \\nnecessarily.  I mean I think there's questions about whether that's the natural grouping.  If you \\nlook at the kind of economic wherewithal that one can bring to bear on these issues, you may end \\nup looking at a slightly different constellation of countries that would be involved. \\n\\nIt's a neat follow-through of countries that are located in the region, but I think the \\nEU is about to launch its Asia connectivity strategy and has substantial financial economic \\nresources to bring to bear there.  I think a lot of this will end up being done bilaterally with \\ncountries rather than some of these sometimes tricky plurilateral formats. \\n\\nI think you saw in the President's trip to Japan as well some announcements of \\nnew forms of bilateral cooperation with Japan in this area.  I mean I think the adoption of the \\nlanguage around the free and open Indo-Pacific was in itself a very sort of significant recognition \\nof some of these prior efforts and thinking that was there on the Japanese side. \\n\\nAnd I mean I think this administration, the last administration, of course, had \\nimportant strategic economic priorities that it was pursuing, including TPP, but this \\nadministration is not.  But I do think this administration has been very seized with this question \\nof how to think about BRI and some of these issues in a way that I think in the end the previous \\nadministration sort of resolved not to come out with a position or a strategy on the issue. \\n\\nWhereas, I think now the free and open Indo-Pacific strategy, insofar as it's there, \\nis moving into sort of implementation discussions and things.  I think a lot of this is very much \\ndriven by trying to address some of these strategic economic issues and specifically trying to do \\n\\n191\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nso with some of these partners--Japan preeminently but I think the Europeans as well, India, \\nKorea, Australia.  \\n\\nI mean I think there's a lot of countries that are pretty like-minded when it comes \\nto these issues with a lot of assets to bring to bear on this.  And I think that's going to be a very \\nimportant part of implementation. \\n\\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  I'm reminded of conversations we just had this \\nweek amongst us about the importance of our allies and how we as we keep moving forward, \\nwe're going to keep them high on our agenda for discussion. \\n\\nCommissioner Stivers, please. \\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Thank you.  Thank you.  A comment and a \\n\\nquestion.  A comment.  Thank you all for your recommendations.  I thought that your \\nrecommendation sections of your testimony were outstanding, especially on OPIC, Export-\\nImport Bank. \\n\\nI think we really need some, some very exact, specific recommendations for what \\nthe United States Congress can do and what the administration can do as opposed to just, you \\nknow, kind of lamenting and exploring what the Belt and Road Initiative is, which is a lot, and \\nthat's important, but we have to think of some plans of action. \\n\\nAnd it's important to remember, I think, that infrastructure is not the only driver \\nof economic growth.  And there are so many different things that we can do to promote growth, \\nand because China is doing it in this manner doesn't always mean that we have to do it how \\nthey're doing it or even in the sector that they're doing it. \\n\\nWe have other strengths, and it's important that we play to those strengths.  So \\nthat's my comment and to thank you. \\n\\nBut a more specific question, something I'm a little bit worried about.  Mr. Harris, \\nyou mentioned that Japan is considering its role and kind of not sure where they are in terms of \\ntheir public role or their active role on the Belt and Road Initiative.   \\n\\nWhat, can you dive into that a little bit? What would that look like on the \\nextremes?  Like on the extreme if they wanted to go all in, would they participate in it?  Would \\nthey fund projects?  And on the other, what are the different--what does participation look like \\nfor things that Japan would consider?  Kind of an extreme and then kind of in the middle of \\nwhere you think they might go? \\n\\nMR. HARRIS:  So I mean obviously one extreme is exactly where they've been \\nright up until now, which is they stay aloof, you know, they have their own strategy, they pursue \\ntheir own projects, they look at the region the way they have, and you know in the main that is \\nwhat they're going to keep doing.  They've articulated their own approach.  They have their own \\nresources.  They have their own institutions. \\n\\nThat is going to be the dominant Japanese approach to the region going forward.  \\nI don't think there's any reason to think that that is going to change. \\n\\nObviously, the other extreme would be full government participation in some \\nform, and that doesn't look like it's on the table, and, in fact, actually one sign that Japan is not \\nactually trending that way, there was an expectation that when the Diet opened this week, and \\nPrime Minister Abe gave his speech to open the session laying out the government's priorities for \\nthe next six months, that he was going to specifically refer to Japanese participation in Belt and \\nRoad as a priority for the government going forward, and he mentioned cooperating with China \\non infrastructure, but it was a much softer mention than I think had been anticipated and \\ncertainly the early news reports had suggested he would say. \\n\\n192\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Table of Contents\\n\\nAnd so there's definitely a cautiousness on the part of the Japanese government.  \\nYou know, I think part of this also is just they're talking with Beijing about this, that there's a lot \\nof negotiations.  Looking ahead to this year, this anniversary year, they want to do an exchange \\nof visits with Abe going to Beijing and potentially Xi Jinping coming to Tokyo either this year or \\nearly next year.  \\n\\nThey want to put out an additional communique.  They've had a series of \\ncommuniques in the last 40 years, and they want to put out a new one in which economic \\ncooperation, presumably through the BRI, would be one of the principles of the relationship.  But \\nI think getting, getting the form of that right, I think, is taking some time. \\n\\nAnd frankly I think Japan, the Japanese government I think is prepared to \\ndisappoint Japanese business in some ways where I think they're much more enthusiastic about \\nbeing involved in projects and cooperating and seeing opportunities to export infrastructure.  I \\nthink the Japanese government really wants to ensure that this is part of the high-quality \\ninfrastructure approach. \\n\\nSo if they see opportunities to there are projects that meet their needs and check \\nthe boxes that they've laid out, I think they'll pursue that and support that and use public \\nresources to back that.  But I think they're going to be very selective.  I think it's very much about \\nthe conditions in which cooperation would occur. \\n\\nAnd I don't think there's any--there's not really any reason to think that Japan is \\ngoing to shift from that approach, that I think they would rather be out than go all in.  It's either \\ngoing to be conditional participation or none at all.  And there is no reason to think that the Abe \\ngovernment is going to look differently. \\n\\nCOMMISSIONER STIVERS:  Okay.  Thank you. \\nHEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN:  Well, thank you, gentlemen.  We appreciate \\n\\nyour testimony today, and that of all of all of our witnesses during today's three panels.  The \\nCommission and guests have indeed been further steeped in Belt and Road, but you can count on \\nthe fact that we're all going to have to keep monitoring it. \\n\\nAnd I'm grateful for Jonathan Hillman's database so we can quickly at our \\nfingertips map it and see how it's evolving. \\n\\nSo for today we stand adjourned, and I hope you'll join us for our next hearing, \\nwhich will take place on February 15.   \\n\\nThank you. \\n[Whereupon, at 3:29 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.] \\n\\n193\\n\\n\\n\\tPresident Pro Tempore of the Senate, Washington, DC 20510\\n\\tSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515\\n\\tHearing on \\u201cChina\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative: Five Years Later\\u201d\\n\\n\\tBlank Page\\n\\tBlank Page\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN: Good morning, and welcome to the first hearing of the U.S.- China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2018 Annual Report cycle.  Thank you all for joining us, and those of you online as well. The Commission has been following Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative since its inception in 2013.  Since then, we have watched the initiative rise to the top of Beijing's foreign policy agenda, evolving from a vague blueprint for regional connectivity to a well- resourced, whole-of-government strategy. President Xi's signature foreign policy initiative is many things: an economic stimulus plan; the global face of the \"China Dream\"; a marketing strategy; an upgrade of Beijing's \"going out\" policy; a blueprint for economic dominance; and much more. It's difficult to overstate the potential risks and rewards of the Belt and Road Initiative, both for China and for partnering countries. Chinese infrastructure projects have the potential to offload some of the excess industrial capacity currently weighing down China's economy.  If executed well, they could provide crucial economic opportunities for developing countries around the world.  They could also help burnish China's image as a responsible stakeholder and divert attention from more aggressive aspects of its foreign policy. On the other hand, poorly-run projects that prioritize Chinese gains at the expense of the host country's economy and citizenry would be no more than empty economic gestures and could bring significant unpleasant reputational costs to Beijing. Perhaps more concerning, Chinese economic engagement could give way to dangerously lopsided bilateral relationships and create opportunities for Beijing to employ greater economic coercion against smaller partner countries. Security risks abound as well.  For example, although the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is arguably the most developed and promising component of the Belt and Road Initiative, Pakistan has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world for Chinese workers and citizens.\n",

            "HEARING CO-CHAIR TOBIN: Thank you. Our first panel today will explore the economic drivers and implications of the Belt and Road Initiative.  We are joined by a truly outstanding group of experts to discuss this subject. We'll begin with Nadège Rolland, Senior Fellow for Political and Security Affairs at the National Bureau of Asian Research. Prior to joining the Bureau, Ms. Rolland spent two decades advising the French Ministry of Defense on Asian and Chinese strategic issues.  She is the author of the 2017 book China's Eurasian Century: Political and Strategic Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative, which I highly recommend for you to read.  It's compelling. Ms. Rolland will provide testimony today on the economic and strategic drivers and goals of the Initiative, and she'll describe how it has extended China's diplomatic reach and its soft power. Next we'll hear from Jonathan Hillman.  Mr. Hillman is a Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies where he holds the Simon Chair in Political Economy and is the director of the Reconnecting Asia Project.  And I want to give a shoutout to that because for those of us who like to see data or visuals, this website is a resource for anyone of us to use. There's a map showing the probably hundreds, or more, projects that are underway as part of the Belt and Road Initiative and the infrastructure projects.  But it also contains a database that you're going to be maintaining over time to catalog what's beginning, what's done, what's never got underway, et cetera. So prior to joining CSIS, Mr. Hillman served as a policy advisor at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.  He will discuss emerging trends and the Belt Road Initiative's impact on China's trade and investment patterns. We'll then hear from Randy Phillips.  Mr. Phillips is a Partner at the Mintz Group\n",

Through the course of preparation for this hearing, I have been thinking continuously about risk management and when everything is this gigantic, be it a Marshall Plan or a moon shot, from the way we Westerners think of it, there is risk management going on heavily. In China, I know their mindset is different, but--and you all keep saying we're at the early stage; we're at the early stage.  How are they going to from the Chinese mentality approach this huge vision of theirs?  And I want to get concrete on risk management.  How is it being done in the local company level? And maybe, Randy, you could, since you've been on the ground there out in different provinces a lot, you could start off with that, but I'd like to hear from each of you.\n",

So, Dr. Ratner, your recommendations for U.S. policy were, I felt, outstanding, and I want to give you an opportunity to orally tell us a little bit more about three of them, please. You just mentioned the one about rebuild institutions for U.S. information operations so that we can lay out the facts and the fictions of the Belt and Road Initiative to make people who are receiving some of these potential--what would you say--opportunities from China better understand what's going on. So I'd like you to just spin that out a little bit more.  Tell us how it would work, what the United States could do, could one, two, three be set up?  Who would run it?  That's the first piece. The second piece is shortly after that you mentioned capacity-building for recipient countries, and there you talked about establishing something that could be quite straightforward, a clearinghouse of best practices or a forum to assess BRI projects.  If you could talk about that. And lastly, TPP.  As you know, both sides of the aisle have in the last political years have pulled away from that.

This will be the third panel that I'll introduce in a minute, but before I do, I'd like to give special thanks to the Commission staff, to Michelle Ker--where are you, Michelle--from our economics team, to Caitlin Campbell and Jacob Stokes from our security and foreign relations team.  They worked together with Commissioner Shea and me and with our witnesses during the recent months as we prepared for today's hearing. Thank you all very much for this joint hearing that was well put together. So on our third panel, we will explore regional reactions to the Belt and Road Initiative and various competing visions offered by countries such as Japan and India.  We have an impressive lineup of experts to discuss these topics. We'll begin with Andrew Small.  Mr. Small is a Senior Transatlantic Fellow with the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund.  Prior to this position, Mr. Small was based in the Fund's Brussels office for five years. Mr. Small will provide testimony this afternoon on South Asia's response to the Belt and Road Initiative with focus on Pakistani responses to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and how India is responding to the Belt and Road Initiative on a strategic level. Next we will hear from a Commission alumnus, Joshua Eisenman.  Welcome back, Joshua.  It's good to see you.  It's great to have you here today. Dr. Eisenman is an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas' Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs.  He's also a Senior Fellow for China Studies at the American Foreign Policy Council. Dr. Eisenman will testify about developing world perceptions of and responses to the Belt and Road Initiative drawing on his forthcoming book, which focuses on China's strategies in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast\n",

I was delighted to read your testimony, and I was reminded, and as you laid out the facts of the amount of investment Japan has and some of the frameworks that they have, I was reminded of our trip this last year to Thailand and to Myanmar where it was really clear what role Japan is playing in parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia. In your testimony, Mr. Harris, you spoke about two things I'd like you to expand on.  First of all, you mentioned Japan and India announced the creation of Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, and I'm wondering if you can expand on that. And then on the next page, page or two later, you spoke about Japan's free and 187 Back to Table of Contents open Indo-Pacific strategy framework.  So could you give us for the record more details on both of those?  And is Japan somewhat purposefully trying to play a little, not below the radar, but, you know, are they being wise to be not too confronting so that would be for you, Mr. Harris? And Dr. Eisenman, in your testimony, you spoke about, on page 14, that BRI would open new opportunities for fraud and corruption, and that many of these countries, which we all obviously know are rated poorly on corruption and transparency indexes.  Can you comment on the risks that you see for China in terms of money laundering and how that might be a factor as they--you mentioned how much debt, but, you know, it just seems like there are some other risks?

I think some of you may have traveled far and wide to join us.  So thank you.  And appreciate the time and effort you've put into your excellent testimonies. China does not have a monopoly on plans to facilitate connectivity and trade across Eurasia and the Indian Ocean region.  During our hearing today, we will examine regional reactions to China's Belt and Road Initiative as well as competing visions for regional connectivity, which have existed long before the Belt and Road Initiative. For example, the United States launched the New Silk Road Initiative in 2011. Today, other regional powers, such as India and Japan, are actively promoting their own initiatives to bolster economic growth and infrastructure development.  These efforts present opportunities for the United States to work with its allies and partners to provide complementary or alternative options to China's Belt and Road. Chinese leaders hope the Belt and Road Initiative will advance Beijing's geopolitical interests by improving ties with neighbors, securing supply routes, and expanding China's role in regional and global governance.  But deeper involvement abroad also comes with risks, including terrorism and instability, fractious local politics in partner countries, and great power rivalry. In response to these risks, the People's Liberation Army has accelerated its preparations to protect growing Chinese interests overseas.  An increased PLA presence outside of East Asia, driven by the Belt and Road Initiative, will create both geopolitical opportunities and challenges for the United States and requires a thoughtful strategic response from Washington. Secretary of Defense James Mattis recently said, and I quote, \"In a globalized world, there are many belts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of dictating 'One Belt, One Road'\"--unquote.\n",

It's really brilliant and highly readable, which I particularly appreciate.  So it's really good. But you asked a question in the title of your book, and I want you to answer this at some point today.  You say it's called \"China's Eurasian Century,\" and then you put question mark.  So I want you to answer that question mark at some point during your testimony. But my question is about--I think Mr. Phillips and Mr. Hillman also alluded to this--that there's sort of a lockstep mentality in China about Belt and Road.  My experience is if you want to get money in China, if you're a think tank, you put the words \"Belt and Road\" on a project, and you get support. I'm wondering could you tell me what is the level of domestic criticism or domestic concern within China?  If everybody is speaking in one voice 100 percent, that's not necessarily a good thing.  I mean sometimes a little criticism leads to improvement.  Maybe we have too much criticism here in Washington and not enough improvement. But in a system where everybody is walking in lockstep, it could lead to disastrous results.  So I was wondering if anybody could sort of tell me are there voices within the Chinese system that express reservations about Belt and Road or at least aspects of it? Anyone?\n",

Before joining CNAS, Dr. Kliman worked in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy where he served as Senior Advisor for Asia Integration.  Dr. Kliman will provide testimony on China's efforts to expand its security presence around the Indian Ocean Rim and across Eurasia, how these efforts relate to BRI, and implications and options for the United States.

The first question deals with something you touched on in your testimony, Dr. Ratner: Russian-Chinese competition in Central Asia.  And many of these countries obviously were former Soviet republics and are in many respects culturally Russian. So my very high-level simplistic sense is that the Russians have ceded the economics to China in the Central Asian republics but have not ceded the security sphere, and the Chinese are careful about not offending Russian sensibilities on the security side.  So I'd like you to react to that. And the second question is something that you said, Dr. Kliman, that triggered a thought, the Malacca Dilemma.  We hear that a lot of the BRI initiatives are the pipelines from Russia, from Burma, from Central Asia are designed to solve or mitigate the Malacca Dilemma. But my sense is that they need so much oil, they need so much natural gas, that 103103 Back to Table of Contents the Malacca Dilemma will never be resolved through overland pipelines from Russia, Burma, Central Asia.

So my understanding is that in Pakistan, China is relying on a 12,000 strong Pakistan security force.  Part of the projects go, are in Balochistan, which is a very tenuous area of Pakistan. I was wondering if you could just give us a briefing on how the security, the local securities is doing there? And then, Dr. Eisenman, another thing I thought the Chinese learned from their global investments was that they can't just bring in all this labor, Chinese labor.  They have to sort of integrate local workers into their projects. But then you said that one of their objectives is to deploy their--of the Belt and 181 Back to Table of Contents Road Initiative--is to deploy their excess labor.  So I was wondering if you could, if you could flesh that point out a little bit?  And what, do they have a number associated with their excess labor?

            "MS. ROLLAND: Thank you very much, Commissioner Tobin, Commissioner Shea. I'd like to start by thanking the Commission and its staff for inviting me to testify as part of today's hearing.  It's an honor to be here and a privilege to share this panel with Jonathan and Randal. It would take a little bit more than the five minutes and 45 seconds that I now have to unwrap what Xi Jinping has himself called the \"project of the century.\"  As a matter of fact, it took me over a couple of years of research to try to understand it and a couple of hundred pages to try to describe and explain it. So I thought that today I would kindly invite you to refer to my written testimony regarding what the Belt and Road Initiative is all about and what purposes it serves from Beijing's perspective, and I would like to focus more specifically on a few questions raised by the Commission staff in preparation for this hearing, as well as on a few points I think might be helpful to keep in mind throughout the day as you listen to my distinguished colleagues' testimonies. So I would like to make four main points. The first, BRI is not just about infrastructure.  Second, it's not just about economics.  Third, it's just beginning to take shape. And fourth, Beijing is deadly serious about it. So let me elaborate on each of these points.  First, BRI is generally perceived as an infrastructure project.  It's true, but it's not just that.  It's really a comprehensive vision for a regional, political, economic and financial integration under Beijing's helm--a region that comprises two-thirds of the world's population and half of the world's current GDP.  And as China makes inroads in this vast region, it's inevitably going to reshape the region's economic\n",

            "\n",
            "MS. ROLLAND: I think the voices of reservations are not publicly available, but if you're talking with people, they might--some of them might have some reservations and think that maybe it's a bit too early for China to go out like this, and I think that some scholars have said that there might be a risk of overstretch for China.  These are difficult countries that they're going to invest in, and so what kind of economic return are they going to get? And all the problems that we can see here, they can see them too, you know, problems with conflicts and not great economic returns and so on and so forth.  So, but the center has given the directions, and now they have to fulfil the vision and try to find ways to make it happen knowing that it's not going to be easy. About \"China's Eurasian Century?\" I think it depends on us whether it's going to be a period or a question mark.  The title comes from, I think, as you could imagine, the balance with the Pacific century, and how maybe I think that China's dream is to re-become the central power over Asia and Eurasia.  This is what the China Dream is all about. And so if it's going to extend its influence over this continent, it might become Eurasian, its Eurasian century, and the Pacific century might become a thing of the past.  I don't read in crystal balls.  I'm just saying--\n",

            "MS. ROLLAND: Yes, thank you. I would totally agree with everything that's been just said.  I think for the security of the Chinese assets and citizens, China is constrained by its noninterference policy right now. So I think they're starting to think about how to get around this, and there are several ways that I can already see coming. The first is the delocalization of the security.  So you put the burden of the security of your assets and citizens on the local military and security forces like what we've seen in Pakistan.  We've seen it also in Ethiopia, for example. There is also increasingly, and Randal is right to point out to this, that private security companies--Chinese--that are very active now and getting more important. There is an increasing security cooperation bilaterally, and also we're starting to see emerging a sort of regional security cooperation with local countries and China so maybe an emerging regional security framework really going on to tackle those risks as well.\n",

You are making others helping you finance those infrastructure projects because it's good for Asia. So you spread the risk among everyone else.  You just, it's not just China taking the financial burden.  That's one point. If those countries can't repay their loans, then you seize their assets.  You ask them to give you a 99-year lease on your port or you ask them provide oil or gas for a number of years, for example.  That's another way to have some kind of economic return.

I think that's also very important to follow.  We have to think of it as a very comprehensive network and, you know, if you can control the Internet over that big area, you have a great advantage also.  It's not just the trains going full one direction and back empty.  I think there's another dimension that we tend to forget.\n",

But from the central government perspective, the idea is really to try to reduce the development gap between the coastal provinces that are more developed and the landlocked ones, some sort of prolongation of what happened around the 2000s when they started to implement the Greater Western Development Plan. 5252 Back to Table of Contents So now the idea is that instead of having development coming from the eastern shores down to the landlocked provinces, those provinces would be sandwiched between eastern coast and the entire region, and cross-border trade would also help them growing their own, their own economy and so on. So reducing the developing gap.  Those provinces have also an increasing--that's interesting--an increasing role in foreign policy as well.  So, for example, Xinjiang is a dedicated province to try to develop ties with the Turkic world, so Central Asia but also Turkey. Ningxia, which is a Muslim province, has lots of ties with the Gulf countries, for example, building on this identity of Muslim world.  The southern provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi also have more dedicated ties with Southeast Asia, for example.  So you can see that they are sort of specializing into building more ties with their closer neighbors, and that's also an interesting thing to follow.\n",

            "MS. ROLLAND: There's a word that has come back in several of the commissioners' comments this morning.  It's colonialism.  I think we tend to see what China is doing through our own lenses and through our own experience.  I think in Beijing's eyes, it's not about colonialism.  It's about \"all under heavens.\" I was struck when I was doing my research about this project about how everything goes back to historical references to maybe a mythical past really, a mythical history where China was, you know, the empire was respected by its neighbors and had some diplomatic ties with the region, going also through the tributary system. Some scholars in China and the strategic thinkers frankly refer to that past when they talk about Belt and Road.  So, and people tend to be very skeptical about that.  Who would want to be a vessel state to China nowadays in 21st century?  How is this possible?  It's a myth. I think we're starting actually to see this already.  So the Belt and Road Forum, the famous BARF, that we all like a lot, I think was a very, very symbolic of that sort of tributary system.  People didn't kowtow and didn't put their head on the floor in front of Xi Jinping, but they came with gifts, MOUs, and in return for that, they got access.  They got investment.  They got protection. I think this is the kind of mindset that you need to think about when you're thinking about Belt and Road.  It's a different--it's a different thing that we're looking at.  Again, it's foreign, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't work. If you look also at companies, big companies that are being silenced on the fact that they cannot write Taiwan as a country on their website or whatever, that's also part of, I\n",

I want to go a little bit beyond that and think about not just the industrial standards and all the international standards but also in terms of intellectual leadership.  China has been offering tens of thousands of scholarships for students to go study in China--students from Belt and Road countries.  And that's part of one of the five pillars of Belt and Road.  It's about people- to-people exchanges. And in my mind those scholarships are not just for students to come, learn Chinese, but it's also, I believe, a way to train the elites of these countries so maybe in the long run there will be a better understanding between China and those political and military elites in the region through those people-to-people exchanges and scholarships. So when you think about standards, it's not just about industrial and high-tech standards. It's also about training future generation of leaders in the region.\n",

This is a big \"going out\" on steroids strategy.  So yes, they've done that before in Africa, and they also came across some problems there, and I think they have learned from it. The same as their relation with government.  You know, traditionally I think that the central authorities in China tended, used to privilege their relationship with the actual government without looking or forming bonds with opposition parties or other members of the political elites. Over the years I think China has improved this capacity to know better different actors in the countries and not just focus on the government. And similarly I think now being aware of that importance of civil society, I think they're also trying to reach out to those, to those groups in a different way. I think there's, here it's more bottom up approach, probably coming from the SOEs themselves or the firms that are actually operating on the ground and trying to at their level figure out how to be more engaging with the local people.  And I think they're trying to set up some good standards of behavior for their workers and trying to maybe employ local workers so that they can also be engaged in the project itself.

China is really going out to develop mostly developing countries.  And they don't really have other alternatives, and so I think the U.S. and its allies--that's the European in me that's speaking.  I think this is something that we have to do together. The U.S. itself won't, has the capacity, but I think this is really something that we have to do in cooperation with its allies in Europe but also in Asia.  India and Japan have started to provide those alternatives, and I think there's a lot of things that we can, we in the U.S. can do more and better in conjunction with those initiatives, again to provide alternatives for these countries.\n",

The idea has been going on for quite awhile in the intellectual elites of Beijing. So--and I think the first mention of this idea, not called Belt and Road but really the components of it, the first one I saw dates back 2001.  So if one thing, the Asia rebalancing policy maybe has accelerated it, but it didn't--it wasn't born out of this.  That's one, one point. I think it's also why do we see China going out so, so abruptly now?  It's also in reaction I think to what they perceive as a U.S. disengagement in the world, and so they're seizing this opportunity to go out, more forcefully outside. So if the U.S. is more willing to reestablish its credibility as a global leader, that 6161 Back to Table of Contents will also have an impact on how China sees its role in the region.

            "MR. HILLMAN: Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. In keeping with the panel's theme, I will focus on the Belt and Road's economic dimensions.  Very briefly, I'd like to just touch on four areas: first, key trends in Belt and Road projects; second, China's tools for advancing the Belt and Road; third, the Belt and Road's economic and political impacts; and also implications for the United States. As has been mentioned, I think the Belt and Road is probably the best known but least understood foreign policy effort underway today.  And for all the attention it receives, there's little reliable information about how it's unfolding in aggregate. A major challenge is that the BRI label evades classification, both geographically, temporally, functionally, and I think by design, the BRI is really a vision and in some cases a loose brand more than it is a masterplan with strict criteria for inclusion. Infrastructure is not the only component of the Belt and Road, but it is a major component, and I think it's important in that it provides a window into the Belt and Road's drivers and broader implications.  And for the past three years, CSIS has been tracking infrastructure projects across the Eurasian supercontinent. We have a database of about 2,200 projects--transportation projects--that include not only Chinese-funded projects but what others are doing in the region, and as that database grows, several trends are emerging.  I'll just note one of them that has I think both economic and political implications. So one major question about the Belt and Road is its openness, you know the degree to which others can participate and benefit from it.  And our data to date suggests that Chinese projects are less open to local and international participation. Out of all the contractors participating in Chinese-funded projects within our\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "MR. HILLMAN: So with some of the infrastructure projects we track, I think one of the big contrasts between the Western approach is that a lot of the risk management is done up front before a project is started, and so that's often why it can be slower to start.  There are studies that are done.  You know, the China model is often faster and let's deal with the risks as they come up as we encounter them in the projects. But I also think that, you know, more broadly a lot of our thinking sometimes about how China is executing these projects is probably three or so years out of date because I do think that there's learning that occurs.  You know they're not immune to criticism.  Criticism that's happened in Africa, I think, has impacted how they operate in Central Asia. I think that there's a willingness to try to hire more local labor because of the political risk if you don't do that.  I do think that there have been instances of holding up funding because of corruption, including in Pakistan, you know, withholding funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "MR. HILLMAN: So, yes, but I think it's also these risks differ so dramatically in all of the places that we're talking about.  So, yes, you know, generally, they're challenging business environments.  But the risks that you face--the security risks you face in western Pakistan is not the same that you face in Eastern Europe, and Belt and Road is so sprawling that I think it's very difficult to talk about these risks at that high level.  I think it's a really sort of country-by-country framing.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "MR. HILLMAN: So I think there is no question that the overland component of Belt and Road is the most ambitious part of what is already a very ambitious vision.  And that's because for hundreds of years most commerce has traveled by the sea, right, and I don't, I personally don't think that this is going to really change that dramatically. 4949 Back to Table of Contents Something that we're looking into is the emergence of these new China-to-Europe rail services, which it seems like every month there's a new, you know, from Chinese City A to European City B service that's announced.  But these are heavily subsidized routes, and the optimistic projections of them have them doubling their share of trade between China and Europe over the next decade.  So doubling sounds like a lot, but it's going from 1.25 percent to 2.5 percent. And so if you're in the air freight business, you might be worried about that eating into the business that you do.  I think the maritime story remains where most of the action is, in large part because of many of the challenges that you pointed out have been shown in colonial history with building projects beyond your borders. I think there's also, there's an American parallel too.  Next year is going to be the 150th anniversary of the Transcontinental Railway, which it included shady financing.  You know it led to an economic crisis.  The costs in many respects far exceeded the returns, and so I think that for all of these reasons, the maritime domain is probably where the real action remains.\n",

            "\n",
            "MR. HILLMAN: Yeah.  Thank you.  So happy to provide some further detail on some of the project comparisons that we've done with multilateral development banks versus Chinese-funded projects. I think with some of the terms I think it does vary.  I think one of the differences, so about three-quarters of Chinese official finance is commercial terms.  So it's going to be higher interest rates than you would get.  You know, it's not concessional financing like you would get from an MDB.  So I think there's a difference between the rates.  They're often able to do that, though, because they're willing to go where those other lenders are not, and I think that's something we need to think about because we can criticize and illuminate the risks of pursuing risky projects, but until you provide better alternatives, I think it's very difficult to persuade someone. I mean just put yourself in the shoes of someone considering those offers.  On the one hand, you have a project that can start tomorrow that you can announce and have a groundbreaking ceremony, and, on the other hand, you have warnings about, you know, longer- term risks.  And I think that we need to think more about providing some better alternatives.\n",

HILLMAN: I think the transparency part of this is critical, and I mean it's a huge challenge for researchers, but it's a practical challenge too for people who want to participate in these projects. So we have, on our website, we have a page for each project that we track, and there's a number of data fields on each project page.  So as an experiment, one of the things we did was we basically gave each page a report card, how much information do you have, and it was a little bit surprising.  We actually, the Chinese lenders and the MDBs came out all sort of in the B to B minus category. But I think it's very difficult to know about the things that you're not aware of; right?  And so a trend that we have observed is that some of the China Development Bank projects, in particular, that we have, we don't know about them when they're in their earliest stages.  We know about them when they're further along, and the earlier stages is where the opportunities are to sort of become involved. And it's also the opportunity to know what the terms are and to do your due diligence on that. So I think the transparency issue is key and hopefully something that, you know, those institutions will improve on and something we should ask them to improve on as well.\n",

So Sri Lanka was just mentioned, and I think it's a fascinating case of both some of the rewards for China even when things go wrong, and so, you know, in the southern part of Sri Lanka, which I had an opportunity to visit just a few weeks ago, there's a port at Hambantota that we're probably all familiar with that was built by Chinese contractors with Chinese financing, and then when the government couldn't pay back the loan, China took equity in the port.  They now have a 99-year lease, and this is in a very strategic area of the world that's, you know, miles from some of the busiest shipping lanes. And if you go there today, it's, you know, kind of on lockdown.  It's been handed over to Chinese companies to run, but there's not a lot of economic activity there, and it's a dramatic contrast.  It's like night and day between that port and the port in Colombo where there is lots of, you know, cargo vessels coming in and out. In Hambantota, you can look into the Indian Ocean and see large vessels going by in the distance, but none of them are coming in, and I think that's not going to be great for Sri Lanka in the longer term because, you know, this was sold as a development program for an area that had been hit by a natural disaster, for an area that had been traditionally undeveloped. And I think we also need to be careful about how we respond to this now that it has happened so there are proposals to develop yet another port in Sri Lanka on the eastern side in Trincomalee, and this is a, I mean naturally there's World War II history there, naturally a very\n",

I also think that the standards part must be part of the solution, and I think that, you know, that's done through a number of fora, and, you know, standard setting is done both with partners and allies, but it's also done through the U.S. leadership position in multilateral institutions, and so I think it's important to sustain our leadership in those institutions, and I think it's important to also expose instances when standards are not met, and tell those stories about the consequences of adopting, you know, lower standards, the consequence of adopting lower quality instead of paying for higher quality up front. And I do think, though, even though I mean I agree entirely about the importance of data, I think some of these standards questions, the data and the infrastructure go hand-in- hand.  The infrastructure building is often a conduit through which standards are accepted and spread, and so I think that we need to, as Nadège was mentioning earlier, consider this holistically, both the data side and the infrastructure that makes the data possible. I don't think the solution is to, you know, meet China head on with our own subsidies.  We're not going to out-China China.  And I think that we need to focus on what we're good at and what our companies are good at, which is providing reliable products, which is upholding standards, many of which exist and need to be enforced.

It's a more compelling U.S. vision and I think it's been encouraging that there's been support building for the free and open Indo-Pacific concept, but I think more needs to be done to operationalize that, and I think, you know, at the end of the day resources matter more than rhetoric. I think there's a series of things that Congress could do to help operationalize that concept, which isn't the entirety of Belt and Road. Belt and Road goes other places.  But that does seem to be the sort of central opportunity right now. I think one thing that could be done is, you know, instructing the administration to come up with principles and standards for quality infrastructure.  That term gets thrown around a lot--quality--and I think there are competing definitions for what it means, not only in terms of outcomes but even more difficult to define the necessary processes that get you to those outcomes. I think that's something that we can develop also with partners and allies. And then again I think funding, you know, fully resourcing and maintaining the U.S. leadership position in multilateral development banks.  For the U.S. commercial agencies that are involved with this, I think that there's, you know, certainly always merit in considering could we streamline some of what we do and combine functions?  And I know that's a sort of longer-standing debate that many, some people have tried, and certainly merit in thinking it through. I think at the end of the day the basic functions need to be there, and we need to support them.  China has a whole host of tools that a lot of which have been mentioned today\n",

I think as broad as Belt and Road is, it still is nowhere near a replacement for what that was and could still be. The trade component of Belt and Road is mainly bilateral deals under a large banner.  So it's not, it's not, it doesn't have that larger market creation, the rule-setting component that TPP had.  So I do think that that is something worth thinking about. I think your question of foreign assistance and development is also critical.  One of the things that makes Belt and Road so compelling is that it's this positive vision for countries whose number one priority is development. And so I think until the U.S. provides its own vision- -it need not be framed in opposition to Belt and Road; it needs to be its own positive economic vision--I think that would be the best response.\n",

            "MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you very much and thank you to the Commission for this opportunity to address this issue. Similar to my fellow panelists on this, this issue is something that needs to be taken very seriously.  As was mentioned, when this came out in November of 2013, it caught many people by surprise, mostly the Chinese bureaucracy and the SOE realm because this had been coming out of an internal Communist Party think tank, this idea, and it was latched on to by Xi Jinping as similar to some of his other initiatives that we have seen before and since of rejuvenating China and bigger, more ambitious programs. It certainly has become something that is--that the bureaucracy has very much rallied around. China, which is the country that invented bureaucracy, knows how to get a program passed, and so now every agency of government, as well as state-owned enterprise, in China has their own internal Belt and Road commission internally to figure out how they can get a project passed, subsidies gained, and call it Belt and Road.  So it's a very amorphous piece. If you look at the mission statement--it's beautiful--that China has for Belt and Road Initiative, it talks a lot about win-win cooperation, which we see in a lot of other elements of China's foreign policy.  This is something that on the ground in Beijing we like to say that means China wins twice, but it's--we semi-morbidly joke with our Chinese counterparts on that. But sometimes it feels that way.  But it's a beautiful mission statement. But really if you look at what drove this program for Xi Jinping to put forward, I would say there's five or six key things that need to be addressed. First, the timing of it.  It was certainly coming on the heels of the U.S. pivot to\n",

            "MR. PHILLIPS: Not yet or not, none that we have seen as of yet.  And I would say it's early days as I think you mentioned earlier.  Certainly you look at the SOEs and actually many private sector companies in China, they've all put together for the reasons you pointed out their own Belt and Road committees. Certainly in the early days of the Belt and Road Initiative when everybody was trying to figure out what this all was, you saw, particularly in Southeast Asia, a lot of the projects that were already underway or already investments anticipated being repurposed and called Belt and Road Initiative, and as particularly state-owned enterprises went back for more funding or went to the China Development Bank or to Ex-Im, China Ex-Im Bank, it would be very useful to call it Belt and Road to be able to apply for those funds. I think if you just look at the total amount of actual executed funding so far for Belt and Road Initiative, it's fairly, it's less than what was originally thought was going to be at this point, but it's still early days on it.  So I think at this point it's still very useful to a lot of the companies. Internally, in the Party, they haven't really spent that much money on this yet. But even with China's significant foreign exchange reserves and capabilities, with the other problems they're dealing with right now, if, depending on how the pace of these projects being executed, those voices could raise in the coming few years if some other economic priorities start pressing.\n",

And I can tell you from a concrete sense what I've seen on the ground now for a couple of years.  Previously there wasn't much of an industry in China of think of it like Blackwater-type company to be able to provide security for Chinese companies abroad. Now there's a vibrant industry there, and there's been a lot of interest and interaction from Chinese officials, as well as state-owned enterprises and the private sector, in the last couple years reaching out to U.S. and others around the world to try to develop that expertise, realizing that as they project their investments out into more hostile environments, they're going to have to protect their workers. And then it also plays out on the PLA side of capabilities to perhaps have to evacuate and deal with those type of contingencies.

But it's not seen as an economic win, at least not yet.  It could potentially turn into that, but it's much more of a soft power projection and a way to further build influence together with other major projects that China is doing with Made in China 2025 and the great rejuvenation of the nation.  That's all packaged together. Economically, more people can paint a case, just as you did, that it could be a loser or at best break even than anything else.  I would say that when you look at the Maritime versus the Road, technically the Road is the Maritime, and why they did that, I'll never know, but I think a lot of people are looking geostrategically, and I would imagine some of the panels this afternoon will talk about this. At some point or another, it's going to come up against Russia's interests in Central Asia, and that's a real friction point that I think everybody is waiting to see how that plays out. Certainly in the sea portion, I've spent a lot of time in ASEAN doing briefings actually on this issue, starting a couple of years ago, and everybody there is very mindful, particularly the Singaporeans, of what this all means for China's projection of force. But at the same time they also see it as an economic opportunity so they're trying to hedge each way, which is something that, of course, we're used to seeing.  But I think it most\n",

            "MR. PHILLIPS: No.  Thank you very much for those questions, and particularly to your first point, what is success has been something in the front of my mind from the very beginning of this.  I think this is such a beautiful political program that it's beyond belief.  Why? Because you can define success any way you want.  There's no end date; there's no target dates. Arguably, Beijing could say today that's successful, and it is for many of the reasons we've talked about already of just the ability to bring those many, that many leaders to Beijing in May and national level delegations and have the ability for Chinese firms to have the extension and the development of soft power they already have is arguably success. So the beauty of it is there is no end target date.  There is no hard and fast objective or criteria that anybody can really lay on this to say did you meet what you said you were going to do or not because they haven't really said what they're going to do. Now your point about the debt is I think as critical.  I think it's been pointed out earlier that there are some real land mines in that and problems that some places are already experiencing. Look at Sri Lanka, for example.  Just some of the projects that weren't even called Belt and Road before that are sort of that now have already caused debt issues that become political problems internally and then become a bilateral issue with China, and then it's going to depend on how China reacts to that. Do they seize assets?  Do they try to come out with more concessionary terms?  I think that's, that's one of the real areas to watch as this unfolds.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "MR. PHILLIPS: If I could just add one piece on that.  I think this is very important whether it's on the fiber optic side or any of the other industries of the Made in China 2025 industrial policy, which is basically, as you all know, ten broad categories of industry that are at the heart of 21st century economy, the economy today and tomorrow that are obviously very important to our economy. That can't be seen in isolation from Belt and Road Initiative because if Belt and Road Initiative is even somewhat successful, it sets out the broad framework for China to further compete well and grasp the, as they call it, the commanding heights of those industries, which are going to further be detrimental to our ability to compete in those industries.\n",

I think it goes certainly on the subsidy--the cash side of this is certainly important.  But also as a lot of my colleagues in Beijing would comment and have been for a number of years--standards has been something.  Patent standards, the who sets the rules of the road.  China has been working diligently for years now, very successfully, in using their market power, just their domestic market power, to be able to change that dynamic and force a number of companies into accepting standards that they might not otherwise have to do. And that market power is only being expanded now with Belt and Road Initiative in a sense, but that is absolutely playing into, particularly the technology piece, of the competitiveness.  And so we're often seeing now concerns about how China is coercing technology transfer as part of the ability to have market access in China.  That is only going to grow with this, this process. 5656 Back to Table of Contents That is going to absolutely affect how some of our best companies are able to compete in that market and beyond and will set the stage for how they have to deal with partners elsewhere.\n",

But I'd go back to the point that was raised earlier about China just sees this process differently than we see it through our eyes coming back to the colonialist aspect of this. They genuinely through their own internal dialogue and rhetoric and belief is that it's-- China's a great country and others are lesser countries, and it doesn't mean that they're bad. It's just that they're lesser.  And that China is doing good by this and that others ought to be thankful for that, and therefore they're less concerned about the civil society piece of this than we might think. And I'm not making that as a value judgment.  It's just they don't quite see it as a heavier burden than others might see it.\n",

And again I can't stress enough that we can't look at any of this in isolation.  Belt and Road Initiative, as ambitious and broad as it is, is also together with Made in China 2025 and other soft power projection of what China does and is trying to enhance. I mentioned earlier about some of their ability to deal with civil society, et cetera. They're quite good in their United Front Work Department, the Party, and across the world in working with other political parties, civil organizations, to influence.  That's their job in life. That's essentially what we're talking about here.  They'll get better at this and do it.  But this is a deadly serious program.  So we have to have our eyes wide open.

It wasn't about trade to those of us on the ground in Beijing.  It was about the fundamental principle here that we've been talking around this entire hearing, and that is China's market power and its ability to throw its economic weight around to the potential detriment of the United States. How do we compete against that?  The U.S., as powerful as we are and as strong 6060 Back to Table of Contents of an economy as we are, we are not the size economy as part of the whole in the world that we were after World War II.  We're not going to be able to win this by throwing money at it.  We're going to need allies, and we're going to need to partner with others. And the whole benefit of TPP from our perspective was it changed that fundamental dynamic that is at the heart of all this, that China believes that you need that market more than they're worried about losing your investment.  So how do you change that? Well, you create a bigger market that China is the odd person out, and now you've got 40 percent of the world economy operating at higher standards, a different set of benefits, and suddenly there's an incentive there for China to have to at least moderate some of its behavior to be able to compete. Now how you get from here to there, that's up to Congress and others to decide how to do, but that was the only game in town that we saw--the TPP--to be able to at least try to get us from here to there.  So something has to get us from here to there.  And hopefully we'll\n",

Any company worth its salt is there trying to compete, and some are competing very well.  Many are held back by market access restrictions and other aspects of a fairly closed system in many sectors that we've talked about a number of times before.  But the Belt and Road Initiative in this regard is, I think, symptomatic of the broader issue with China. It's how do you get access to it if you're a U.S. company to compete, and how do you learn of the opportunities?  How do you partake?  How do you conduct compliance activities to make sure you're doing well by your fiduciary responsibilities, et cetera?  And obviously get a return on your investment, make it economically viable. This is something that virtually all of our members in the American Chamber in China have looked at Belt and Road whether or not--similar to their Chinese counterparts--of is there something in here for us?  Is there an opportunity?  And they are trying to figure that out. What we've seen thus far is it's been more on what we'd call the software side of things.  Rather than the major infrastructure players getting the project through the front door, it's subcontracting for logistics, finance, consulting, et cetera, that kind of piece, and it hasn't been in large numbers yet.  It's been very, very small. But then again the overall amount of enacted Belt and Road projects really hasn't been all that great as of yet.  So I think it's still to be seen how much U.S. companies are able to compete in this.  But it, again, comes down to providing a framework for U.S. companies to\n",

So when I look at this One Belt One Road, I'm just a poor old former public servant, you know.  I'm not an economist or anything else.  It looks to me like they're spending an awful lot of their money--I'm talking about the land bridges now--to build infrastructure in other countries.  That's what it looks like to me. In other words, it's almost like a colonial power building roads in its colonies 4848 Back to Table of Contents except they don't have the colonies, and that didn't even work for the colonial powers really. So what are the terms?  I mean they're not going to own these assets, right?  So that's the first thing.  They're not going to own them so they have to get, they have to have decent terms on the loans, and the loans have to be paid, and you all have already commented on how unstable the countries are.  So I'm looking at this and thinking, maybe more so than you guys are, that this is a loser for them on the land bridge stuff. Now, Mr. Phillips, you said something about the maritime that I think is different because there, it seems to me, they could end up getting a lot of really strategically important points under their control to protect their sea lanes. So comment on both of that.  I mean is there a basis, do you think, as American policymakers consider this for distinguishing between the land bridges they're building and the Maritime Silk Road in terms of how we ought to deal with it and what the implications are for us?

Is it an expectation of employment?  Is it skills, expertise?  Kind of what is the provincial interest or commitment?

Dr. Ratner, I too am kind of intrigued by what you were talking about, particularly in terms of Afghanistan.  But and the reality of it is, of course, that China has built its economy and has built its military under the U.S. national security umbrella.  And I think what you are putting out there is we need to question whether this continues to make sense under for us in some locations. I'm not saying a retreat from the region or anything like that, but does it continue to make sense for the U.S. to be paying money and blood in order to have China be the beneficiary of our presence in places, or is it time for them to step up to the plate, to be the global citizen?  So I think that that's really important. I want to switch just a little bit on the security issues.  Some of the things that have happened, of course, as you say, the Chinese have been pretty open and clear about what 112112 Back to Table of Contents they're doing, but as their presence is growing on the Belt and Road countries, it provides military opportunities that might be there.  Railroads allow you to move troops, for example, and roads, you know, they make the movement of personnel and weaponry easier if you need it.  I think always of Tibet there in a context like that. But are there places, places, for example, in Eastern Europe where you think that there are going to be challenges that the U.S. military is going to have to respond to because of an increasing Chinese presence, and certainly in Eastern Europe, I would put an increasing Chinese/Russian presence? I'm just trying to think, usually when we think of flashpoints, of course, we think\n",

Would you see that there would be participation by U.S. and some of our allies' tech companies? You know we're in a context right now both that we have limited money to invest in things, but also American companies are under an enormous pressure from China.  We've seen what's just happened with Marriott, Google.  They are interested in trying to get into China. Whether they would be willing to participate in an initiative that China would see as contrary to the Chinese government's interests, I'm just--I'd just like to hear a little bit more what you're thinking about with the digital development bank.\n",

But talked about tributary states.  I'm inclined, actually, frankly, I'm perhaps a little bit more cynical than some other people in it.  It's a concept that I find makes perfect sense when you look sort of at China's rise and displacing the United States and all of that. 185 Back to Table of Contents And so I find myself wondering how much, how much is legitimacy an issue or how much is just sort of sheer power politics?  I could put the word \"fear\" out there, but power politics.

Thank you all for being here today and for just excellent work you've done on this issue and, in particular, the focus that you've had on the noninfrastructure side of the Belt and Road Initiative because I would say 80 to 90 percent of the literature that's written about Belt and Road is about the infrastructure part of it. And this other part on the high tech, the telecommunications, I think is more of a concern for the rest of the international community than the infrastructure part of it although they're both concerned.  Angela Merkel just said, I think yesterday, that data is the raw material of the 21st century, and the question of who owns the data will decide in the end whether democracy, a participatory social model, and economic prosperity can be combined. And, of course, there's major implications if, you know, the fastest growing region of the world with two-thirds of the world's people and half of the world's GDP is dominated by Huawei as the major telecommunications provider for that region and Baidu as the dominant GPS satellite for that region.  And how do you compete with that? I mean there's so much incentives provided by the Chinese government through Made in 2025 and a host of other things.  You know I know we compete on infrastructure, the Japanese can, the Koreans can, the World Bank can, the Asian Development Bank can.  They need more help certainly, but I see a healthy competition on infrastructure if the international community, you know, is up to it. But on the high-tech side, can we compete? And how?\n",

On the role of civil society, what we have, you know, one of the big advantages of international development best practices is that they engage with--it's supposed to at its best engage with the people more so than the government. There's always a role for both, but you don't see China doing that as much. 5757 Back to Table of Contents Their deal is with the government.  They're not transparent, and the people are often an afterthought, which has gotten a lot of these projects in trouble.  I think the two, you know, major openings that have happened in the region, in Sri Lanka and in Burma, have had a direct correlation to China's development projects in those two countries, and I think that correlation is significant. So are Chinese leaders kind of understanding the role of civil society in these countries more?  Are they becoming more sophisticated in that engagement part of it?  Or do they just not get that part of it?  Because obviously the success of their projects are going to need to have that engagement from the people who are affected or the different, or civil society in these countries in order for them to be effective. Are they making changes in the way they're addressing these projects or not so much?\n",

But since we're talking about TPP and trade, let's get into that a little bit without getting into the trade, whether for or against it sort of thing. One of the things, I mean you all mentioned, I think some of you mentioned that the Belt and Road Initiative was a response to the Asia pivot or the rebalance.  And, you know, China's leaders were worried about that.  The problem I've always seen from the rebalance is that TPP was the only significant economic component of it.  And China recognizes the value of development.  Asian countries, they want development probably more than trade. And the question is we didn't have a strong enough development component, and I think of OPIC, you know, where you have a U.S. agency that can help underwrite loans and brings money back to the Treasury.  It doesn't cost the U.S. government a thing, but yet it can help some of our companies make the investments and compete in the region.   Again, brings back money for the Treasury, but then you have, you know, the new budget eliminates OPIC. Hopefully, I think the administration is coming to understanding the importance of something like that.  But whether it's that, whether it's our traditional foreign assistance that is so much, that is so effective, whether it's humanitarian assistance, whether it's disaster, disaster assistance, health, agriculture, we have an advantage there, and we should be focusing on those things in Asia. But, you know, I think the development component as a response to what China is doing is an important thing to think about.  Do you have any thoughts about that?\n",

I think it's important. And the policy options I think moving forward have to be both in the diplomatic and development components.  I think we have a twofold challenge, and you both have worked in the administration, and I think you can shed some good insight on this.  How do we bring this U.S. government together?  You know, diplomacy and international development are two totally 107107 Back to Table of Contents different disciplines, you know. Diplomacy is focused on building stronger and positive relationships. Development is focused on saving lives and lifting people out of poverty and creating kind of the underlying prosperity and stability that we think is not only in the U.S. interests, but it's in everyone's interests. But there's a real lack of overlap in those two worlds.  Development, there's 15 government agencies that do development--more than that, I think.  Most of them don't work in China.  They don't--shouldn't work in China.  They don't work in China, and they don't have China expertise in them. And then you have a lot of the folks that, you know, they're experts on China that focus I think more on the security and trade realms.  And so you really have this disconnect between two worlds where I think a lot of the solutions or the policy options to compete with China are actually in the development world, but I don't think those folks are thinking strategically about China.  They're trying to save people's lives as they should be because that's their job. So how, you know, how does the administration bring these worlds together, and\n",

As you mentioned, you know, China didn't invent connectivity.  It's been going on for a long time, and there's been numerous initiatives to connect especially South Asia, which is one of the least connected regions of the world.  I mean India is not even connected to itself, much less its neighbors in South Asia, much less to Afghanistan, and much less to Central Asia. And there's been numerous initiatives to try to improve connectivity from India's standpoint and kind of get Afghanistan, in particular, and Central Asia better access to the markets in both Pakistan and India, and that was a major initiative of the last administration, which was called the New Silk Road before China called it the New Silk Road. But my question is this: should the U.S. be going down that road in terms of helping India better connect to South Asia?  And is that a competition for what the Chinese are doing in terms of connecting to everywhere pretty much?  And how receptive is India to that? How much are they doing?  And how can we help India?\n",

But a robust India connectivity initiative could, you know, obviously do a lot for the economies in the region, and whether Japan will lead that or whether the Quad can come together and work on that sort of thing. But it would be a balance for the region in terms of connectivity to two of the largest markets that might make more sense in terms of stability and prosperity for the region. Just real quick to Asian Development Bank. Asian Development Bank has been the multilateral institution.  They do projects in China, in India, all over Asia.  That would seem to me, it would seem to me that the ADB is the institution that is kind of being relegated to the second choice based on all these bilateral development initiatives. And I guess my question is what is Japan's view of the ADB?  I mean from my perspective, it looks like it's being supplanted, and what can we do to strengthen the role of ADB?

I thought that your recommendation sections of your testimony were outstanding, especially on OPIC, Export- Import Bank. I think we really need some, some very exact, specific recommendations for what the United States Congress can do and what the administration can do as opposed to just, you know, kind of lamenting and exploring what the Belt and Road Initiative is, which is a lot, and that's important, but we have to think of some plans of action. And it's important to remember, I think, that infrastructure is not the only driver of economic growth.  And there are so many different things that we can do to promote growth, and because China is doing it in this manner doesn't always mean that we have to do it how they're doing it or even in the sector that they're doing it. We have other strengths, and it's important that we play to those strengths.  So that's my comment and to thank you. But a more specific question, something I'm a little bit worried about.  Mr. Harris, you mentioned that Japan is considering its role and kind of not sure where they are in terms of their public role or their active role on the Belt and Road Initiative. What, can you dive into that a little bit? What would that look like on the extremes?  Like on the extreme if they wanted to go all in, would they participate in it?  Would they fund projects?  And on the other, what are the different--what does participation look like for things that Japan would consider?  Kind of an extreme and then kind of in the middle of where you think they might go?\n",

            "\n",
            "DR. RATNER: Just as a pro tip.  But I'll try to be--I will try to be as close to that as I can and we can come back.  I'm just going to hit the wave tops of my written testimony. Let me just start with the contextual point of the overall trend lines, which I began my written testimony with, which I think overhangs any discussion of the Belt and Road Initiative, which is four points: Number one, the United States and China are locked in a consequential geopolitical competition right now that will determine the character of the 21st century; Number two, the United States is losing that competition right now and increasing the likelihood not just that the U.S.-led liberal order will be undermined, but that a China-led dominated region will emerge; Third, the United States government has failed to approach this competition with anything approximating its seriousness to date, and I say that as a former official; And fourth, despite that and despite current trends, the United States can arrest China's momentum here and prevent the growth of an illiberal order in Asia if we put our strategy and our resources and our attention that are deserved to this set of issues. So I wanted to put that on the table first.  I know you've spoken already about the economic drivers and imperatives of the Belt and Road Initiative.  I do think those are in many ways primary, but the military and the geostrategic effects are quite significant and barely below the surface and definitely worthy of consideration. So, again, thank you for convening this important discussion. I'm going to talk about three things briefly.  Number one, the security benefits, the advantages that China is deriving from Belt and Road.  Second, the security risks that are going to emerge for China.  And then finally some recommendations for U.S. policy in response.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "DR. RATNER: Well, I guess a generic point and a specific point.  The generic point is we should take a hard look at looking where we feel like as it relates to security and stabilization, we are overextended.  Look at where China's interests are emergent and intensifying and where we think that their perception or conception of what they would want is at least with the bounds of something that we wouldn't consider a major national security threat anyway. So if one were to draw that, I think the first place I would look would be Afghanistan.  I think the fact that the United States is spending billions of dollars to build up the Afghanistan military and secure that country when it is surrounded by a whole region that has vital security interests there, and we are bearing the diplomatic and military and human costs of that alongside the Afghan people is quite extraordinary. And I think Beijing has shown that it has more interests there.  There were reports in the last several weeks that they were setting up--it's unclear exactly--but something along the lines of some facilities in eastern Afghanistan, and I think the United States should think seriously about talking to but also telling partners in the region, including working through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, but directly to Beijing, that there are parts of Afghanistan that they will be responsible for stabilizing at Year X. Whether it's one year or two years or three years from now, I would defer to the military commanders about how much time it would take to appropriately withdraw U.S. forces, but I think that's the kind of mentality we need to be in rather than sinking again tens of billions of dollars into Afghanistan while China literally works around it to undermine the liberal order\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "DR. RATNER: Yeah, I would generally agree with that point.  I think the diversification of China's energy sources have been long underway prior to BRI, and it has an economic logic to it and otherwise.  I think they're looking to alleviate sources of vulnerability, and this won't resolve, but it is part of that. But it also goes to the earlier point that I made that what, again, from a purely military perspective what matters or not is if the United States can menace the People's Liberation Army in East Asia and in the South China Sea, and whether the closing of the Malacca Straits affects their energy security may matter on the margins in a long-term military conflict, but what we are at risk of here and what the United States government should be focused on is preventing China from pushing out a sphere of influence and effective control over certainly the South China Sea, if not other parts of their eastern littoral. So I think that's the real challenge, and again if you believe what Secretary Mattis said last Friday, that military advantage is eroding, and that will be much more--whether the United States can and is willing to fight will ultimately be what matters here and not whether China is going to be willing to pull or able to pull energy through the Malacca Strait.  But I think it is part of an overall vulnerability mitigation strategy. As it relates to the Russia question, this is a good example of where the BRI piece of this is part of a much larger question about how does the United States think about its strategic competition with China and where does Russia play into that, and how do we think about mitigating the potential for Russian-Chinese collusion, which exists already, which I think will\n",

            "\n",
            "DR. RATNER: Great.  Thank you. Those are all terrific questions.  On the question of U.S. information operations, to be concrete, the Broadcasting Board of Governors has started a 24/7 cable news Russian channel that has a very significant social media platform as well.  As I understand it, during the Iran protests, Voice of America and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, some of their platforms were some of the most viewed in the world, including in Iran and in China. So they are, in my view, having seen a presentation on this recently, I was, I shouldn't say surprised, but happy to see how sophisticated they were in terms of the people who were in charge there.  They're real communication specialists.  They're thinking hard about how to use data and who their audiences are, and this has been--this effort is focused at broadly addressing the issue of Russian information operations and misinformation operations around the world. Obviously we have that problem here in the United States.  That's not their writ. But they have been, I think by their account, quite effective in the information space as it relates to Russia, and we ought to be doing the same as it relates to China because China has an even more sophisticated, I think, and even more comprehensive set of information operations and systems around the world, and again the story of that, those information operations, is China's ascendant, China is the future, America is a mess, and the United States is in decline, and so you better get on our side or you're going to pay for it. And I think the reality is obviously much more complicated than that, and my understanding is the White House is in discussions with the Broadcasting Board of Governors to think about what is a China element to this, and you all ought to do what you can to support that.\n",

            "DR. RATNER: It's within their charter.  It would be more resources dedicated to I think areas of, areas where we have concern about illiberal Chinese influence, and the goal would be to provide objective news, either in local language or in Chinese language as well.  So I think that's something we could do. Along with that, I would argue that the public affairs and public diplomacy parts of our bureaucracy have atrophied certainly since the end of the Cold War.  But we have very capable people working in the public affairs bureaus and the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy at the State Department, but I think if you were to go and look at their activities, it's a lot of soft people-to-people social programs that aren't integrated with strategic communications is how we would think about it. And so it would be useful for--I think this would have to be a White House-led effort, but to the extent that we use the term \"strategic communications\" within the White House, it's not just about what the President is going out and saying.  It's about coordinating strategic messaging that's professional and driven by people who understand these things, not necessarily someone who has just come from their latest job at an embassy doing political work, but a real communication specialist coordinating messages, getting them to the right people, and using our public affairs offices at the Pentagon and the State Department to their full effect. So I think there's a lot of work to be done there.  I think frankly the administration is aware of this, and they're focused on it, but it will take more resources and it will take better interagency coordination than we've seen to date.  So that's on that point. On the second, the issue of capacity-building for recipient countries, I think, I\n",

            "DR. RATNER: But, again, it's important. As relates to the TPP question, it's very hard, you know.  It will, I think it will honestly take strong leadership from American politicians to make the case that, number one, again, we are in a consequential strategic competition with China that it will down the road affect the wealth and security and prosperity and freedom of the American people and their children and their grandchildren in subsequent generations if we don't get serious here. And that that is the lens through which we should look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and if there are negative externalities as it relates to opening our markets, there are ways that we can deal with that through domestic policies, and there are people looking at that, and free trade, I think it has been assessed certainly from now going forward is not the answer here.  And, in fact, setting higher standards is standing up for the American people, and, frankly, as a Democrat, quite disappointing to see Democrats make a progressive--I know this isn't a partisan commission--but to see Democrats making an argument against what was largely a progressive deal that would have raised standards for women and children and the environment higher than 50 years of American diplomacy will do on its own waving its hand and through the USAID. So I think there is a case to be made.  It will take political leadership, and it will take a larger sense of the meaningfulness of the strategic competition with China. Just the last thing I'll say on this is that obviously the Trump administration has elevated the issue of China's unfair trade practices to the front burner, and I think we've already seen the solar panels case decided upon.  Steel and aluminum are coming down the pike.  And the then the 301 case as it relates to intellectual property and other unfair practices I think will be\n",

China strategy is Asia strategy, and often we get it the other way around to our own detriment.  And, yes, comprehensive means diplomatic and economic and development, and I think the point I was trying to make earlier, we have to be firing on all cylinders to get this right, that if we think of the security challenges of BRI in a narrow military lane, we're not going to have the influence that we need and the resources and power to bend the curve on this. The only other thing I would say in addition to what Dan said is I think there's a relationship between the diplomacy and the development.  I think the other, perhaps the most, the more fruitful area, at least in the short term, is thinking about getting more China watching and more China expertise out of just the East Asia bureaus because we have things happening like when the Chinese flipped Panama on their diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and all of a sudden it's, well, who was--do we have a China watcher in our embassy in Panama City, and the answer is no. And I think--and I know this is something that the last administration and the, particularly the policy planning they were thinking about, and they may have made some headway on, but we ought to have China experts in the places where these projects are happening, looking very closely and understanding what's going on.

So I think the communication of this from the very top all the way down, from you all sitting here, from members of Congress, from people who have the time to think and research about this, is really important. To answer your question specifically, because I've thought a lot about this, and you get this challenge a lot--again, it's a group challenge, not otherwise--the answer in my mind is you got to start at the end and work backwards because the China challenge is so incremental and it's so multifaceted that any one piece of it is hard to wrap around your finger and tell you why it matters. And so what you have to do is you have to put people in the future of a China-led order and make them understand what that looks and feels like and why they're not going to like it. And Nadège Rolland, who was on the panel earlier here, she had a great monograph on the Belt and Road in which--actually, she has a full chapter dedicated to describing what Eurasia looks like--I don't know what the year is--2025 or 2030--if China fulfills its economic and political ambitions in that region, and it's pretty sobering. And I think it does get back to, you know, for hundreds of years, the United States has tried to prevent a rival hegemon in Eurasia so as to allow trade and investment and ideas to flow West and prevent security threats from flowing in this direction.

I think in terms of areas as far as Eastern Europe, I think the answer is no, that it is not that a Chinese foothold or access agreement is going to undermine the military advantage of the United States and NATO. We're very far from that. The Chinese for a variety of reasons--this is a wholly separate topic--but their force projection capabilities are still, they're growing, but they're pretty nascent.  They're very strong along their littoral and in East Asia, but their ability to mobilize, much less fight, even if it were to be on the western end of the Indian Ocean, is very limited still for a variety of organizational reasons, not just capability reasons. So as it relates to Eastern Europe, I think we're still far away off from that.  I think, I guess what I would get back to earlier, which is I think we are seeing for sure some of the goodies of Belt and Road affecting decision-making in European capitals, and Greece is the most prominent example here where they threw themselves in front of a human rights resolution, as far as I understand it, that was going to criticize China, an EU resolution, breaking the consensus there, which is quite remarkable.  And I think there are concerns as well about Hungary and other more liberal-leaning European countries being willing to sign up for this. So I think the way that, the way that it matters for security reasons, as it relates to the United States, is that these economic projects, that there will be, there may be military access components to it, and I know this is a bit of a punt on your question, but it's the economic influence that's going to buy the political influence that's going to shape decision-making in these\n",

I think the remedies as it relates to CFIUS reform and other defensive measures folks are taking a hard look at.  It's a big bureaucratic problem.  There's questions around research and development. And then, of course, the broader issue of the fact that us taking actions alone is not going to be enough here, and we need to be working with allies and partners, who if we are effective at blocking China's efforts to either steal or buy our advanced technologies to corner the market on some of these, in some of these areas, that they don't just then go to Germany or Israel or the next stop. And I think we are working on that.  But again I would come back to the best solution to this is a coordinated set of rules.  There are rules around data localization in TPP, and I think, again, if it's not going to be the Trans-Pacific Partnership because that's a four-letter word in Washington, then we can think about rules around fairness or whatever it is, and pull the chapters out of that that we can work with partners, and then, of course, connect them up to TTIP and the Europeans, which was the original intention of building a high-standard global trade and investment regime, which is quite important. So I think that's where the answers lie, and I don't have the political--the political question you asked is the really hard one.

I want to commend you for holding a day-long hearing on different aspects of BRI.  It's a very important issue that cuts across many of the U.S. government's traditional regional offices and functional areas of focus, one that is very hard for the U.S. government to get its head around.   And this type of hearing I think it crucial to informing the U.S. government as it tries to formulate a response, very much hopefully in the larger context of how the U.S. deals with a rising China. I want to quickly give you some of the wave tops of my written testimony, and I may stray a little bit beyond seven minutes but I promise I won't go on too long beyond that. First, again, context to emphasize.  China seeks to transform the rules-based international order, and BRI is one element of that larger approach.  While my testimony is going to focus on BRI, it is important to keep in mind the larger context, which is the need to formulate a U.S. response that is nested within a positive American strategy to reinforce the rules, norms, relationships, and institutions that have underpinned peace, prosperity, and democracy expansion for more than seven decades. Turning to the drivers beyond BRI.  As you most likely heard during the last panel, they are primarily domestic economic relating to China.  But there are certainly geostrategic and military considerations. Above all, President Xi Jinping's vision of national rejuvenation, a China that is predominant in Asia and a leading power globally in 2049.  And then there are long-standing concerns about China's energy dependence on potentially vulnerable sea lines of communication and a desire to stand up new China-centric regional and international organizations. Given BRI's enormous ambitions, even if many projects never deliver or fall\n",

            "DR. KLIMAN: Absolutely.  I want to, before answering that, take a step back, 102102 Back to Table of Contents and I think it's important to keep in context the criteria by which some of these investments were made, and they're not necessarily pure kind of return on investment, but there also are certainly geopolitical considerations. So even if China doesn't make significant returns on investment, it gives it long- term leverage over a country, particularly one with some strategic geography, that may be a net win. To give you a few very concrete examples. One that is often raised, of course, is Sri Lanka where over time China rapidly built up certainly Sri Lanka's share of debt that was owed to Beijing and was ultimately able to essentially parlay the Hambantota port in the southern part of Sri Lanka into a 99-year lease.  India ultimately was able to come and take a kind of nearby airport and make a financial bid so China did not get both the airport and the port. But that's kind of one key example. Djibouti is another where you saw rapid increase in Chinese debt over time. China, of course, built the commercial port and then was able to build a military facility as well. So two countries, again, where you've seen significant debt and then, at least in one, there has already been a military facility opened in Sri Lanka.  Obviously we'll see where that goes.\n",

            "DR. KLIMAN: I would think it's--I don't know on a case-by-case basis.  I would imagine some of this is simply incentivized for Chinese firms to go out and make these investments and call it Belt and Road. I think there certainly is a logic behind it that although these may not always pay off commercially, there may be a geopolitical payoff.  I personally don't have the insight into kind of the decision-making that happens in these particular investments if there is a sort of let's know that there's not going to be any commercial payoff, but we'll get something geopolitical in return. I would say it's probably not seen as a negative for leadership in Beijing, but whether there's kind of a calculus that's very deliberate, I wouldn't know.\n",

So in terms of will BRI mitigate the Malacca Dilemma, I would generally agree, I think at best partially, just given the sheer volume of oil, and, yes, China can build ports and pipelines and overland routes in places like Burma or Pakistan. My view would be that it at least provides--it would, it makes any kind of U.S. military operations potentially more challenging where there are more areas that would require focus in terms of the maritime domain, and so it does, in that sense, complicate a little bit, but it's not going to necessarily kind of wean China off kind of the Malacca Strait. Probably at the end of the day, China's best bet is the kind of clean energy investments they're making now, which over the long-term are designed to make their economy less reliant on oil writ large, whether it's imported from sort of ports in Burma or through the Malacca Strait.\n",

In terms of bridging the divide between diplomacy and development, I would say my hope--we'll see if it plays out--is that the kind of elevation of long-term competition with China in this new national security strategy will trickle down.  It's obviously incumbent on people at the White House to ensure that people, you know, all the different bureaucracies are socialized into that. But that ultimately I think having a fairly clear guidance from the top on this is kind of U.S. strategy, we are competing with China, you should think of your activities in that context and not in a simply let's do good for the world although that's important.  I think that will be at least useful. One other piece is trying to encourage, and maybe there's a role for Congress in this, but trying to encourage more China expertise to go into places like USAID.  It's often very hard to get people with China expertise into national security bureaucracies.  They shockingly spend time in China often or have family backgrounds, and so it may be easier in some ways to open up the development space to folks who want to serve, and it may be hard for them to go into the kind of national security side of the government. So I think there may be opportunities there to creatively bring more talent in, and 108108 Back to Table of Contents if you can essentially be kind of building on the sort of supply side more China expertise in development, and then have the demand signal from the White House in national security strategy to help people understand that there is a competition, that may be positive.

KLIMAN: If you look at, I mean it's interesting, if you look at the kind of dawn of the Cold War, there was a very deliberate effort by the Truman administration to sort of very much simplify and distill the Soviet threat in terms everyone could understand, sometimes perhaps even exaggerate aspects.  So I don't think we want to go in that direction. But in terms of how we could kind of distill it for the American people, in some ways I think we're at potentially the right time where we've loosely touched on some of the China kind of trade and investment challenges that this administration is beginning to take action on, and to me that speaks very much more kind of to people's pocketbook, and it's that do you want to live in a world where China doesn't play by the rules and your livelihood and those of your children are less versus a world in which all countries, including the U.S., play by the same rules, and your, kind of your labor will result in you get what you deserve as opposed to China kind of cheats, and ultimately it's going to harm you and your descendants? And so I think the economic piece is maybe a little easier to sort of convey.  I agree when we talk about a rules-based international order, it's more challenging. I do think, though, aside from the economic piece, there's an important values component, and then ultimately at the end of the day, I mean this country stands for bringing 110110 Back to Table of Contents dignity and certainly more choice and freedom to those beyond our borders and that the sort of world that China would look to construct would be very much one in which certainly the dignity of all people is not respected, that people have fewer choices about their own lives, and that you\n",

The one thing I would add is that you could imagine some of the frictions created by Chinese investment under BRI going into Eastern Europe will play to Russia's current strategy, which is also targeting many of these same countries, trying to divide the EU. So in that sense, perhaps not even deliberately, that China will in some ways advance Russia's strategy versus Europe, which is to sow division. In terms of kind of other military points, I think it really depends on ultimately the 113113 Back to Table of Contents types of capabilities that China deploys.  In Djibouti, certainly in the near future, to me the main risk would probably be those of accidents, that if the U.S. and Chinese militaries have bases nearby or are operating in close proximity, we do have rules of behavior for air and maritime encounters.  I don't think that quite extends or it would be interesting to see how folks in the U.S. government would interpret that when it comes to having bases in near proximity, which is a new challenge.  It's not something that we've had to deconflict before. So I think there is certainly the risk of accident. Looking kind of at other locations of the world, Gwadar, I would say the challenge is probably more for India than the United States in the near term, that if China was to put more military capability into Gwadar or nearby, it would certainly serve as a way to kind of monitor Indian naval activities in the Arabian Sea, and I think already causes Delhi great concern.  I suspect you'll hear more about that in the next panel. Sri Lanka, no Chinese military presence there now, but, of course, given Sri Lanka's position kind of at the top of the Indian Ocean across the sea lines that go from kind of\n",

But where sort of it is right now, one, I think you could frame it in a way that wasn't explicitly countering China, that the world needs digital connectivity, and so we could frame it much more as part of a positive U.S. economic engagement strategy in Asia and beyond. And in that sense I think make it much more of the sort of promotion that U.S. does already to help our companies export.  So I think you wouldn't have to frame it in a way that would spook American companies from wanting to be part of it. I mean you could imagine certainly foreign companies and governments wanting to be part.  You'd also have potential tensions if you have U.S. companies and foreign companies that have the same sorts of products to sell.  But I mean to me it certainly--our companies do have an advantage in digital infrastructure that they don't if you're looking at building ports or railways.  It's just not something that the U.S. at this point does. 114114 Back to Table of Contents And so I would, it would be interesting to look at whether even a small amount of money that Congress either could allocate new funds or from kind of existing trade promotion authorities that it might be able to kind of create something much larger.

In terms of Belt and Road, to me, it's more an appendage to the AI strategy that China recently had in their kind of AI development plan. There was some language about trying to build AI along the Belt and Road and cooperate with countries through new research centers. There's honestly not a lot yet in the public domain on kind of the intersection of AI and Belt and Road.  You can imagine going forward that I mean in terms of the larger kind of digital implications, whether it comes to like encryption standards or sort of how China's Internet governance model, it might be a way for China to advance that. In terms of the military side, I mean you well know I mean that certainly there is a kind of military competition in the AI domain, and to me the main I would say asset that BRI would be for China in that sense is AI runs on data.  Data is sort of the advantage.  And so if China can essentially gain access to more and more data along Belt and Road, that gives it an advantage that along with this domestic market where they have 1.4 billion almost citizens and much freer rules on certainly using data for the government, that it simply gives them more of a resource to play in the AI space.\n",

Apologies also, the infamous flu bug that claimed Dr. Wuthnow also claimed the long form version of my testimony.  Sorry.  You only have the summary and my physical presence for this today. I'm going to try and cover three areas: CPEC, Pakistan; India's reaction; and to a certain extent Sri Lanka. In South Asia, a lot of what we're talking about so far is political reactions to the Belt and Road, still not yet considered economic assessments.  And I think that's true, even true for Pakistan, which is the most advanced set of projects that are there. There are a lot of very high dollar value sums thrown around, not all of which are born out on the ground, and I think this is partly leading people to generalize from relatively slim data, single cases that may not actually exemplify China's approach or where China itself may draw varied lessons. And I think in the first place with the Belt and Road Initiative, we do also need to focus on how Beijing and recipient countries are adjusting to their experiences rather than always assuming we can extrapolate. The first case study for this is Pakistan, which I've testified on here before so I won't kind of reprise a lot of the basics around CPEC.  CPEC has actually gone through a number of course corrections in the early stages.  First of all, the Chinese government left a lot of the narrative setting to the Pakistani government, and this produced a number of problems. Most of the inflated numbers come from the Pakistani side.  You saw a high level of politicization of the project in the early stages, and you even saw problems for China in its\n",

The competitive piece of this relationship, clearly it's partly about providing options for governments and partly about providing information to civil society, members of parliament, journalists, to enable them to better scrutinize what's going on, and I fully agree that that's the thrust of what we should be doing. But I think even with that, we have to be realistic.  Even with good options, a number of these countries have reasons to take Chinese money anyway.  Sometimes it's cheaper. Sometimes it's targeted to political needs.  Sometimes they don't want to adhere to high standards.  And sometimes it gives these countries leverage against other traditionally dominant powers in their own region. In South Asia, that's India.  In Central Asia, that's Russia.  In Europe, it can even mean the EU or Germany if you look at cases like Greece and Hungary that were mentioned earlier today.  The EU money that has gone into some of these countries vastly dwarfs anything that the Chinese have put in or are putting in now. Nonetheless, these countries still see certain advantages in taking Chinese resources, and I think we have to be conscious of that.  I think the important thing is that countries, and particularly some of these developing countries, are resilient, that they're not coerced, they have good options, and that they understand the repercussions of their choices.  But we will have to deal with the fact that greater Chinese presence is going to be a fact rather than expecting that we're always going to be able to counter it even with prodigious resources available.

So I mean I think, as you point out, because there is such a significant deficit already there in terms of connectivity, I think there is really significant capacity to pursue complementary initiatives in the region that don't just function as competition. The needs are very significant as you point out.  A number of them are--there's even more needs inside India itself.  A lot of the Japanese initiatives are internal to India. There's significant deficits there.  So I mean I think it's possible to do this in a manner that doesn't, isn't wasteful, doesn't simply heighten the geopolitical competition with China and the region if it's pursued effectively. I mean I think the Japanese model is still, to me, the kind of gold standard on all of this in several respects.  There's real money behind it.  It's got significant private sector involvement and buy-in.  It's differentiated clearly--the Quality Infrastructure Initiative. It dovetails very closely with the political agenda that India has in the region.  But it also involves a kind of conditional offer of partnership with China on very specific terms that have just been laid out before, just in December, in terms of the sorts of projects that Japan is willing to work with China on under the BRI. So I think that's the kind of zone that one has to get into.  And, of course, the other thing is there's a serious trade agenda there, and that's a piece where, of course, India lags in terms of its own enthusiasm for involvement in high-standard trade agreements and things like that. And I think that is an area where it would be helpful if India could be drawn in more effectively to those sorts of frameworks that Japan has been pushing very effectively in the last period of time.\n",

There were things that they used to be careful about.  They were quite careful about Gwadar.  They were quite careful about the kinds of investments they had. And then they really started amping it up with CPEC, and they kind of tried--they actually tried to pursue a slightly de-hyphenated approach to the two countries.  It doesn't work in the region.  The Chinese relationship with Pakistan is something that India sees in various ways as a critical security concern, and they just didn't do--that they hadn't done economically with Pakistan what they had been doing before.  India--they went to the Indians and said, oh, this will be helpful to you.  This will stabilize Pakistan.  This will deal with de-radicalization things. India completely understandably sees the relationship through a security prism and wasn't buying it. And I mean some describe China as having strategic contempt for India.  They don't take its concerns seriously enough.  I think what's played out in the last couple of years has been a significant corrective to that.  India has political influence, it has military influence, even if it doesn't have the same resources that it can bring to bear financially and economically. The two cases that I mentioned, and I mean you could see the same thing with the Maldives.

The numbers could go substantially higher even than 12,000.  It's basically just guided by the scale of the projects that are there. There's a Maritime Protection Task Force as well operating in the vicinity of Gwadar.  Basically mobile.  And this is added to a lot of the protection measures that have been put in place after some of the incidents that took place back in 2007, 2008, around that sort of time. They've actually done a relatively good job of securing Chinese personnel since that time. There was a period of time in which there were a number of kidnappings, killings of Chinese workers. In the period since then with these sort of stronger protection measures that have been put in place, you haven't--you've had near misses in Karachi.  You've had the kind of bombing incident and things.  You haven't had Chinese workers working on these kind of dedicated projects kidnapped or killed. There is a current potential exception.  There was an engineer that disappeared in Kahuta, which could be the first kidnapping case, which should be rather sensitive. The interesting thing is the greater concern is actually not the protection afforded to the projects themselves.  It's the other Chinese that are coming into the country as a result of this and are operating outside this protection umbrella.  The case of the missionaries that were killed, kidnapped and killed in Quetta, for instance, and all of the incidents, in fact, that have taken place.

You had this great initiative and you didn't have things moving forward on the ground.  When you look at the early contours, and this is why I highlighted the Pakistan case in the way that I did, governments that were willing to shovel projects to the Chinese, allow the Chinese to come in on the kinds of terms for their companies that they want in a significant way, established a relatively privileged position and political salience that they might not otherwise have had. Initially I think they just wanted something to show for it, and so--and the second element in the very early phase was a kind of political consent.  It does actually matter to China that India didn't turn up to the forum.  They pushed really hard and they sent endless arrays of diplomats.  The ambassador in India still comes up with suggestions for renaming CPEC and things that get expunged from the record and things like that. They do actually want this to be acquiesced to by countries, and I think one of the priorities through this first phase was buy-in just at the political level.  I think they consider where they've got to with Russia a success.  I think they consider what's happened with Japan in the last period a success. I think in some cases even if it's just nonresistance, that's okay.  I think in India's case they just wanted acquiescence to CPEC and things like that.  But I think that partly, in the first phase, those were partly what they wanted.  I would just note, as well, I mean I would agree with everything that my fellow panelists have mentioned on this. There are some very ambitious country specific objectives over the very long-\n",

            "MR. SMALL: I think it's partly a decision that they will really have to make in the next period of time as to the relative priorities in this respect. I think they have tried to do everything together and have not, have, you know, they had debt-for-equity deals, looked for dual-use ports, given contracts on terms that are not particularly generous, not been transparent.  I mean they've looked to fulfil all of their objectives simultaneously, and I think they are running into legitimacy problems in some of these cases, and they are in some cases running into certain forms of resistance.  And they don't want--as in other fields as well--kind of, as it were, countervailing coalitions that will work against them and undermine their efforts. So I mean in some of the cases, it's just a practical response to what's going on.  I do think this was, as they envisaged it, the more kind of benign version of what they were doing, a soft way to advance their power position and interests over time in ways that countries would accept.  I think they were surprised by the reaction of countries like India actually, as well.  I think this is one of the other reasons that they, that they kind of had some of these missteps. I think they thought that money would talk and people would want to see the benefits of investment from China and things like that.  I think the reconceptualization of what's going on for a lot of countries in rethinking what the economic ramifications are of certain kinds of relationships with China is putting them in a trickier spot.  And if they make certain adjustments in the next period of time, then there's a different sort of impact. I mean the AIIB, again, in Chinese context, the AIIB is the sort of gold standard\n",

            "MR. SMALL: Just to add really on the administration piece, where the current U.S. administration is at, I mean I think the striking thing is the last time the Quad was convening, it was essentially a security-focused discussion. This time when you had the assistant secretary-level meeting taking place, late last year, a large proportion of the discussions were precisely focused on the strategic economic issues. Now, as I think Dr. Kliman flagged in the discussions this morning, is the Quad the natural structure through which to have those, to implement some of these things?  Not necessarily.  I mean I think there's questions about whether that's the natural grouping.  If you look at the kind of economic wherewithal that one can bring to bear on these issues, you may end up looking at a slightly different constellation of countries that would be involved. It's a neat follow-through of countries that are located in the region, but I think the EU is about to launch its Asia connectivity strategy and has substantial financial economic resources to bring to bear there.  I think a lot of this will end up being done bilaterally with countries rather than some of these sometimes tricky plurilateral formats. I think you saw in the President's trip to Japan as well some announcements of new forms of bilateral cooperation with Japan in this area.  I mean I think the adoption of the language around the free and open Indo-Pacific was in itself a very sort of significant recognition of some of these prior efforts and thinking that was there on the Japanese side. And I mean I think this administration, the last administration, of course, had important strategic economic priorities that it was pursuing, including TPP, but this administration is not.  But I do think this administration has been very seized with this question\n",

            "DR. EISENMAN: Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be back here at the Commission, and I want to thank the Commission staffers, Michelle, Caitlin, my old friend Nargiza, and of course Commissioner Bartholomew, it's great to see you again.  And if I might just recognize one person in the audience, Commissioner Pat Mulloy, my friend and mentor, who's joined us here today. So where to jump in on this.  Oh, very briefly, of course, OBOR is loan driven. All right.  OBOR, BRI, whatever we call it, it's loan driven.  And it's \"build it and they will come.\"  Right.  It's not about necessarily building industrial capacity or industries.  It's about building connectivity. And in this way, it makes it unique in the history; right?  Capitalists tend to want to find cheaper labor so that they can make their products cheaper so they can make profits.  And in that way, OBOR is somewhat unique because it's about building the connectivity into markets rather than actually building capacity in those markets to export back to make more money.  That makes it quite unique. And it's epitomized by three changes in the economic arena, which were summarized by Professor Ren Xiao at Fudan.  I'll just summarize them very briefly.  One is the sheer size of the thing is much bigger.  Second is it's going out further than ever before; hence, our discussion here of the implications for different countries.  And it does suggest a geostrategic shift to the West, right, where China had traditionally had these relationships with Central Asia, the historic Silk Road, et cetera, whereas over the last since China's reform and opening up in '78, we've seen China mostly focus on Japan, Korea, the United States. If you look at China's trade portfolio, it's overwhelmingly with developed countries, and this is a way to almost balance that.  And so that makes it again a unique change\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "DR. EISENMAN: I would say that one thing the Chinese should be particularly concerned about is a speculation crisis.  If you do internationalize the renminbi, you put a huge amount of renminbi out into the world, and that makes it possible for foreigners to buy that renminbi and then leverage it against your country if they want to.  If they don't like your policies, they can sell renminbi.  The price of the renminbi would fall; you'd have to intervene in the markets in order to prevent that from happening. So the more externalization through One Belt One Road leads to more possibility of speculation crisis. There's also a possibility of a political crisis.  Xi Jinping is as human as anyone in this room.  It's his initiative.  If something were to happen to him, the initiative would be put into question, and I can just leave it at that.  We can think of many different other political crises, but I think that's, you know, he's a mortal, period. And then I would say the most difficult crisis for China might actually be an identity crisis; right?  China is not the borrower anymore; it's now the lender.  Its meta-narrative of the defender of the developing countries that it has been advocating since the Mao era and continues today could be challenged if China is seen to be a predatory lender.  If its image is harmed in that way, it has serious reputational risks for the way that other countries perceive of it, but also the way that Chinese see themselves and their role in the world. China is fond of telling others that it is a country that loves peace and loves development.  And if those are called into question through One Belt One Road, then that questions, as I said, the entire meta-narrative that the Communist Party has been promulgating.\n",

            "DR. EISENMAN: Well, I was just going to associate myself with these remarks. It seems to me that there's enough to go around when it comes to infrastructure construction, and that in a lot of ways the ADB is setting the standard, and it can set high standards, as Mr. Small said a moment ago. And it's in setting those high standards that it can, in fact, in fact, benefit maybe from the competition with the AIIB, right, that the AIIB is competing with it and thus making it raise its standards in order to--and raise the amount of funds. So it's got more funds and higher standards in a way that is actually facilitating and enhancing it through competition.  So I don't--I agree with the initial statement you made.  I don't see it as a zero-sum game.  And the AIIB, to my understanding, hasn't really done anything yet. So having done almost nothing and being in Beijing, and Beijing, to my understanding, and, friends, you can tell me if I'm wrong, is the AIIB the only institution in Beijing that's not controlled by the Communist Party of China and is not a foreign embassy; right? So it's physically in a tough location politically, if that makes sense; right? Whereas, the ADB doesn't face this kind of problem.  So I'm not sure that that is hampering it or if other issues are hampering it, but it's certainly the general environment with which the organization exists.\n",

            "\n",
            "DR. EISENMAN: I was just going to agree with what you said, Senator.  So in the Chinese strategic thinking, and much has been written about this, there's a concept called the \"shi,\" or the propensity of things; right?  And so if the propensity of things is in your favor, then you take a particular policy, it's likely to be successful.  But if the propensity of things is against you, even the best thought-out plan is not likely to be successful. So I think that that's exactly right.  You know, the Chinese, the sense of it is very opportunistic.  And so where you find push back, then you move around that push back.  And so to that extent, you can, as a foreign power, benefit from that understanding, but it requires clearly defining your interests; right? My friend, Ambassador Derek Mitchell, has an analogy he likes to think about in terms of basketball.  When you're standing and somebody hits you, the foul is on them.  When your feet are moving and you're all over the place, the foul is on you. And so to the extent that we can have a policy that's clear, I think that that's perhaps the most important thing of all is that our policy is clear and supportive of our allies. You know this, this road that the CPEC corridor, it's going through this territory which is claimed by India; right?  So it seems that, you know, I don't whether it's a strategic contempt or just contempt or just not thinking it through, but it seems that if you're going to drive 180 Back to Table of Contents the road through territory that India claims--whether it's theirs or not, I'm not even getting into that--it seems like you're almost precluding them from participation; right? They'd almost have to change their national policy of territorial integrity to join\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "DR. EISENMAN: Well, thanks for an excellent question. Before I get into it, I have a quick question.  How many, the CPEC corridor, do you happen to know the percentage of Chinese versus Pakistani labor working on it?  Andrew? Okay.  Because my understanding is there is a significant contingent of Chinese as well working on it. So a couple of points to this very important question.  One is in terms of total excess labor, we know China has about 30 million extra men, which is about the entire population of Canada, and it has to find a way to employ these people; right?  Otherwise they 182 Back to Table of Contents become a stability risk. And so the exact number of people that they're looking for jobs for, I don't know. But I know that it's in the millions.  And I know that this is in part the result of their one-child policy and other measures that they've taken for many decades. Now as I had mentioned during my oral testimony, BRI is at this point anyway largely domestic, and that means that employing these people within China is perfectly legitimate as long as they're employed and not causing social stability problems. So in Henan Province where you--or Hunan Province--excuse me--where you may have had a slowdown of construction, now you've got more money going in, which means more people are being hired, which means that your concerns about unemployment within that province are reduced. So the labor issue doesn't necessarily have to be about bringing them outside of the country.  It can also through the BRI Initiative be done within the country. In terms of the external, I think the commissioner is correct, that there has been some push back in terms of having Chinese labor on the ground.  However, I would say in my\n",

            "DR. EISENMAN: So it was a little questionable as to whether or not the law of the country was being implemented.  I don't have any proof to say it wasn't except for the fact that it didn't feel right that it went to the person of the amount of Chinese labor. But so I would say this is a question that has a lot to do with where the project is being implemented.  If it's implemented within China, of course China labor is going to be used entirely.  If it's outside of China, we have to look at the laws of that country and their ability to implement them.\n",

            "DR. EISENMAN: So as I said in my oral testimony, I would say that the BRI Initiative in order to be successful probably has four components.  One is economic.  Another is political, cultural, and then strategic. Economics.  First, I mean deploying the excess capital, the excess labor, and then, you know, probably being repaid; right?  At the end of the day, these are loans, and if they're not repaid, it's hard to see the program as a success. Now, you could go and write off all these loans, but at that point, the question would be why did you make them loans in the first place, right, if they were going to be a giveaway? So presumably you want to either get repaid or you want to get equity stakes for your loans.  Internationalization of the renminbi has been something that's been an ongoing priority for Beijing, and then, as I said, politically you've got to be liked better at the end of the day; right?  If you go through all of these troubles, all of this money, and at the end of the day you lose influence in these countries, it's hard to call it success. And then strategically, building China as a metropole, as an essential part of globalization. All roads leading to China to some degree.  And enhancing China's role as a leading country in the world, a major power, both in a reputational sense and an economic sense and political influence sense.\n",

            "DR. EISENMAN: I would actually say that these two things come together quite nicely; right? The tributary state system is a way to legitimize at that point the imperial government of China.  You kowtow to the emperor; you bring him your shabby gifts, and he gives you silk and jade, and then that legitimizes the grandeur of the throne and the imperial regime. And I was a part of an event in Kashgar not too long ago.  Not Kashgar--excuse me--in Urumqi not too long ago which seemed neo-imperial in that sense; right?  Foreigners coming up one after another explaining why the BRI was going to save them, and the Chinese sitting in their big red chairs, \"um, yes, yes.\"  So it did have this neo-imperial approach to it. But I would also agree that legitimacy is part of the need for a neo-imperial approach; right?  That these things are very much interwoven and connected in terms of legitimizing the government of China internationally; right?  The more countries that acknowledge China, and this is the Taiwan issue as well, it's a legitimization of the Communist Party's rule over China. The more countries that show up to the BRI, the more that legitimize their development- first approach, the more that accept their political rule.  So I would say that both are right and actually very much overlapping of what you both said.\n",

In terms of your question, which is a good one, this issue of corruption, and as this body knows and I'm sure everyone in the room knows, Xi Jinping has been leading this anti- corruption campaign, and this is a signature campaign as much, if not more so maybe, than his BRI campaign, and so the idea that BRI could then contribute to an enhanced corruption seems antithetical to his objective--\n",

If you've got two signature campaigns, and one is doing damage to the other, then that would seem to be a problem. And there is to some degree the internal component.  Maybe Xi Jinping can exert influence, more influence, right.  This is within China so what's going on in Hunan and other places, it's \"gue ne.\"  It's internal and therefore China can to some degree utilize the tools of the anti-corruption campaign.  That is these investigation squads, different internal Party mechanisms to make sure that within China, the BRI is not or is less corrupt. But externally when you're in all of these myriad of different 60-plus legal environments, linguistic environments, cultural environments, things become much more dicey, and my experience is mainly on the Africa side, and so maybe I can recount a quick anecdote. Ambassador Shinn and I were doing research in Angola.  We met with a minister in Angola, and there was a Chinese gentleman in the room so I began talking to him in Mandarin, and I asked him what he was doing, and he said, well, I'm building this particular project, but before I can do it, I need to build a villa for this minister, and he wasn't pleased about it, right?  That came out of his end, right?  And he rolled out the plans--\n",

And the question has been, and I don't know the answer, is how much of that is corruption? Now it's an expensive proposition to begin with, right?  The British lost a lot building their colonial railway.  But the question of whether or not corruption played a role in that is an issue as well.  And so again to go back to the answer to Commissioner Shea, a lot of this has to do with the local environments that they're operating in, and whether the authority--\n",

            "DR. EISENMAN: --or the state is significant enough to check that issue. On the other side, however, in China, traditionally, there has been a corrupt mentality in terms of doing business, and so I've heard, for example, one tale in an African country where the Chinese received a criticism for an environmental degradation.  The Americans received the same.  The Chinese paid off that official and then the official was moved and the paper came back onto their desk. The Americans said, okay, well, we'll pay you a percentage of it, and it went away, and in the end, the Americans paid less to get rid of it, right?  So there is this kind of the nature of doing business in China influences the way that Chinese businessmen behave abroad. That shouldn't be surprising.  That's human nature. But to the extent that China cleans up its act at home, we would expect to see, I think, less corruption abroad.  So the door can swing both ways.  If Xi is successful in his campaign, if he does wipe out corruption, we should expect to see less corruption in the BRI Initiative than in past loans for infrastructure projects.\n",

In the brief time I have today I want to talk about Japan's changing approach to the BRI because right now that's actually a moving target as we speak, how the BRI fits with Japan's broader regional economic strategy, and what lessons, finally, the U.S. can learn from Japan. The Japanese case is instructive because it shows that, on the one hand, building a positive relationship with China may increasingly require engagement with the BRI in some form.  The Abe government has studied BRI participation as part of a broader diplomatic campaign to stabilize Japan's relationship with China as the two countries mark the 40th anniversary of their Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 2018. On the other hand, however, Japan's long road to BRI cooperation shows that it is possible, and even necessary, for Asia's wealthier democracies to pursue that own development strategies to help BRI members minimize their dependence and maximize their freedom of action. Japan may not be able to match China's promises dollar for dollar, but through its willingness to increase its lending, implement reforms to its foreign assistance institutions, and promote private investment by Japanese companies, Tokyo has arguably outlined a possible response to the BRI, even as it considers participating in the Initiative. After years of keeping its distance from the BRI and with the United States actively opposing the creation of the related Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Abe government is developing a strategy of limited cooperation with the BRI.  Japan's BRI strategy is still a work in progress so any conclusions at this point are tentative. However, what we know thus far suggests that the Abe administration is developing a strategy whereby Japanese public financial institutions, like the Japan Bank for\n",

            "MR. HARRIS: So I think, I think Japan has found itself in an uncomfortable position certainly when AIIB came on the scene, and one of the questions was how do we protect this institution that's been kind of our, you know, we've led, we've supported?  It's been one of our vehicles for pursuing development in the region.  I mean but Japan itself has always pursued bilateral development assistance as well. So the ADB is certainly part of the portfolio.  And, look, at this point, it's certainly in a better position I think to fund a lot of these projects than the AIIB.  The bank itself has, I think, indicated that it is fully willing to work with the AIIB.  Look, they, you know, ten years ago identified the infrastructure gap that middle-income Asia was going to face that needed to be filled.  So there--I mean they're obviously at a place where they can lend and support high- quality infrastructure in a way that the AIIB is not ready to do yet. So I mean I don't think there's quite as much concern at this point about whether it's being sidelined.  I mean I think there is so much out there that needs to be funded that I mean they're--they're at the table.  Japan, I think, upped its amount.  One of its initiatives over the last several years is increasing its funding with ADB. So I don't think there's a worry necessarily about it being supplanted.  You know, I think making sure that the United States continues to meet its commitments, the ADB is important, and, you know, supporting that emphasis on high-quality infrastructure is a way to make sure that this alternate vision, I think, continues to move forward and really becomes reality.  So I think that really just making sure the U.S. is an active participant in the ADB is\n",

            "MR. HARRIS: So I think one thing to add, and I wonder if Beijing was taken aback, the extent to which Abe and Modi have cemented a development partnership, you know? You look at the wish, you know, the laundry list of projects that Japan and India agreed on when Prime Minister Abe went to India in September, and it was, you know, he went to Prime Minister Modi's home province and was, you know, a giant celebration. I mean it was this lengthy list of not just, not just, you know, the big ticket projects about the high-speed rail corridor and the subways. I mean you obviously have those big projects.  But so much of what they're doing now is how do you get Japanese companies that are now increasingly diversifying their locations in Asia, and, you know, for the last, for the better part of this decade, you've heard about the China Plus One.  Well, now, India, I think, is on the radar screen for a lot of Japanese companies provided that you can get some of this infrastructure and connectivity in place because I think right now a lot of them look at it and say, you know, maybe, but we need, you know, we need to actually be able to use this. And so you look at that laundry list, and so much of it is how do we get Japanese money here? How do we get Japanese companies as partners?  And, you know, a lot of that is just Japanese, you know, these public financial institutions providing sort of the floor to help the Japanese companies enter the market.

And I think that explains a lot of the dance between Beijing and Tokyo now to find the terms that Tokyo might contribute in some way.  I think it might explain how China courted Australia quite intensively within the last several years to try to get Australian buy-in and maybe even to have Chinese or Australian infrastructure projects as part of the BRI, particularly in northern Australia. Having Japan, having Australia say yes, this is a legitimate approach to addressing a real Asian and global problem, this infrastructure gap, and just the challenge of development, and Japan recognizes it, Australia recognizes it, and I think the creation of the AIIB showed a similar pursuit of legitimacy, the courtship of developed countries and getting them to sign on and getting European countries and South Korea, and Japan, and trying to get all these countries to say, yes, China is putting a real serious answer to a problem that we all recognize and we recognize the solutions to it and we support it. I mean that, I think, is a major concern, and I think it underlies beyond getting a return, beyond just the cold calculations of political influence.  I mean I think there is you're recognizing China's status, you know, that it has risen, it is now providing, you know, true leadership in a concrete--literally a concrete sort of way.

Because I think if it were just about power politics, I mean I think Japan would say we want nothing to do with this, there's nothing for us to gain here, and I think, I think they've recognized that there is a certain amount of leverage that comes from saying, you know, Japan is out or Japan is in.  You know, Japan is a wealthy country.  Japan did this.  You know, in some ways China is following Japan's footsteps in a lot of ways. Japan spent several decades after the war as it rebuilt, trying to build political influence through connectivity, through building infrastructure, through creating opportunities for its companies.  I mean this is, in some ways this is a blueprint.  China is following a blueprint that Japan invented.  I mean obviously on a bigger scale, but this is something that Japan spent a lot of decades doing. And so I think, you know, probably Beijing, Beijing might be reluctant to admit it, but, you know, getting Japan's kind of blessing in some capacity I think is actually important, and also, you know, that it's an important U.S. ally, and so kind of prying, you know, even if it's, even if Japan is finding its own uses for it, I think prying Japan away and saying, look, Japan said this is okay, and it's allowing its companies to participate and it's putting its money in, that means something beyond just simply we're bringing Japan into our orbit. Because I don't think that's actually what's happening, but I think that Japan's currency is something different.  And, you know, that, so that's precisely the kind of series of\n",

I don't think they're at a point now that they're not, they're not starting on projects yet.  I think there's an idea, though, that it would rival some of the maritime dimensions of the BRI.  So that it's connectivity between India, particularly I think--and this is something that I think got China rather upset--that Japan is focusing particularly on India's northeast. And I think the idea would be connectivity between northeastern India, Southeast Asia, and then from Southeast Asia and the port structures in Southeast Asia, then build that out to East Africa. And that really is the idea. But I think they're at the point now where it's something they've laid out.  They're committed to it.  It obviously is part of this broader high-quality infrastructure approach.  But I think this is something that we're going to have to watch going forward to see what actually this ends up looking like, what’s the timeline for getting these projects built. And I think really, as I've mentioned before, I think right now the main thing to watch between Japan and India is what Japan is doing within India, how Japan is filling India's needs for infrastructure now. As much as we're seeing the cooperation in South and Southeast Asia more broadly, I think right now that Japan's role in India itself is, I think, the more important dimension of their cooperation right now.\n",

            "MR. HARRIS: As for the free and open Indo-Pacific strategy concept, this is something that has existed basically in some form in Japanese foreign policy thinking for at least a decade.  When Abe was first prime minister, towards the end of first year as prime minister in 2006 and 2007, took a trip to India, gave a speech in the Indian Parliament where he talked about the meeting of the two seas, and this is something that I think has been close to him for, you know, to his thinking for a long time, this idea of, you know, India, enlisting India as a partner as the region changes, as China's influence grows. And, you know, they would say that we're not trying to contain China, you know- -\n",

            "MR. HARRIS: They're careful to say that that's not the goal, but drawing India into the East Asian balance of power is I think something Japan is very interested in.  I mean obviously they look at demographics and see India is a country that could be important and could be helpful for Japan. 188 Back to Table of Contents And obviously then growing out of that was this concept of the Quadrilateral, and so you had in 2007 the first convening of that, that body that basically then went dormant for the better part of the last decade and only really was revived in November of last year on the sidelines of APEC. And so that is, I think, a concept now that has been revived, but again it's in search of substance, you know, that, yes, military cooperation between Japan, Australia, India, and the United States is, you know, there's plenty of experience there and working together and exercises, and that I think is going to proceed. But I think there's, it's a concept in want of real practical goals that they can achieve, and I think this focus on high-quality infrastructure and articulating an alternative vision of infrastructure investment in the region is something that they could all work on.  And, you know, with Japan's focus on it, with India getting in the game, Australia at least saying the right things if not quite getting there institutionally, there's plenty of material to work with. And so I think as the administration is and the U.S. Congress thinks about how to give more substance to this Indo-Pacific concept, I mean I think infrastructure should be a priority for that discussion going forward.\n",

            "MR. HARRIS: I think, I mean I think it's, I think there are discussions.  I don't think it's at the level of, you know, formal strategy documents yet, but I think, certainly I think in the administration and various departments, I think there's recognition that this is a--you know, this should be a priority, and that it could be done. And again the discussions, I think, in Congress about OPIC, OPIC going forward, I think, are really important, having an institution that can contribute to these discussions, that's going to be the counterpart to JBIC and to JICA, you know, the Japanese institutions that have been doing for so long. And I think there has to be a recognition here that Japan is so much more--\n",

            "MR. HARRIS: --experienced.  They've been doing this for so many decades. You know, they're trusted.  I think the fact of going to Myanmar, going to Thailand, you know, that seeing the Japanese on the ground in all of these places in quite a substantial way and also, you know, the supply chains they have in all of these countries, you know, integrating these countries into Japan's system of production, Japan is going to have an edge here.  And there's no reason why the United States can't follow Japan's lead and ask Japan, hey, what can we do to help you?  You know, you've thought about this more, you have the resources, you have the experience; what can we do to support you? And I don't think there's any reason why the U.S. can't be in a position to ask that, to offer that support.\n",

            "MR. HARRIS: So I mean obviously one extreme is exactly where they've been right up until now, which is they stay aloof, you know, they have their own strategy, they pursue their own projects, they look at the region the way they have, and you know in the main that is what they're going to keep doing.  They've articulated their own approach.  They have their own resources.  They have their own institutions. That is going to be the dominant Japanese approach to the region going forward. I don't think there's any reason to think that that is going to change. Obviously, the other extreme would be full government participation in some form, and that doesn't look like it's on the table, and, in fact, actually one sign that Japan is not actually trending that way, there was an expectation that when the Diet opened this week, and Prime Minister Abe gave his speech to open the session laying out the government's priorities for the next six months, that he was going to specifically refer to Japanese participation in Belt and Road as a priority for the government going forward, and he mentioned cooperating with China on infrastructure, but it was a much softer mention than I think had been anticipated and certainly the early news reports had suggested he would say. 192 Back to Table of Contents And so there's definitely a cautiousness on the part of the Japanese government. You know, I think part of this also is just they're talking with Beijing about this, that there's a lot of negotiations.  Looking ahead to this year, this anniversary year, they want to do an exchange of visits with Abe going to Beijing and potentially Xi Jinping coming to Tokyo either this year or early next year. They want to put out an additional communique.  They've had a series of\n",
